		- I feel that great engineers tend to write very simple logic, avoiding if conditions or other types of conditional branching.
	- LeetCode 127. Word Ladder
		- This was my first hard problem... it was hard to understand the solution though I should have thought of BFS to find one of the shortest paths.
- finished reading The Trading Game: A Confession
