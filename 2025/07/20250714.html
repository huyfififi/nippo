(atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that
satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single
logical operation on the data) is called a <em>transaction</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically, ACID is a set of properties that define key
characteristics a database transaction should uphold.</p>
<p><strong>Atomicity</strong>: Atomicity: A set of operations of a
transaction is treated as a single unit, and it can completely succeed
or fail, and no intermediate state is ever visible to other transactions
or users.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong>: A transaction must move the database
from one valid state to another, preserving all predefined rules,
constraints, and invariants. These valid states are defined by the
schema, integrity constraints such as foreign keys, and possibly busines
logic, making the concept vaguer than the other ACID properties.</p>
<p><strong>Isolation</strong>: A database must handle concurrent
execution of transactions in such as way that each transaction’s effects
are isolated from others. The outcome should be the same as if the
transactions were executed sequentially, one after another. Different
isolation levels provide varying guarantees about how strictly this
isolation is enforced.</p>
<p><strong>Durability</strong>: Once a transaction is committed, its
changes must be permanently recorded by the database, even in the event
of a system failure such as a program crash or power outage. This is
typically achieved by writing data to non-volatile storage (e.g., disk
or SSD (vs volatile RAM))</p>
