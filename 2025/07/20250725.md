I couldn't sleep well last night.

- reviewed a pull request: LeetCode 242: Valid Anagram
- I listened to a Twitter Space. It reminded me of my time in college somehow.
- full-time job (a bit of work)
- 60 minutes walk

TODO:

- Union Find (Disjoint Set)
- check available facilities for passport request
- Fidelity
