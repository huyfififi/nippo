<h2 id="memo-the-trading-game-a-confession">MEMO: The Trading Game: A
Confession</h2>
<p>I found Gary on a Japanese YouTube channel where an interview was
conducted, and he had promoted his book, which had been translated into
Japanese quite recently. It turned out that he himself also had a
YouTube channel, where he talked about wealth inequality.</p>
<p>I watched some of his videos and found that he has a very honest
personality, which led me to believe that most of the content depicted
in his book is accurate. (Though, it is still possible that he is a
psychopath and making things up.)</p>
<p>His story is mesmerizing. He comes from a poor background, is gifted
with an exception math IQ, has worked very hard, and some luck played a
role in his success as a trader at Citibank. However, the book is not
about his success, but rather his dilemma between his poor upbringing
(friends/family), and the very rick traders whom he himself has
become.</p>
<p>He gradually lost his connection with his upbringing just to make a
huge amount of money, obsessed with numbers, and eventually he suffered
from severe depression. The process of losing humanity and getting
depressed is a very heart-touching story, and although I have almost
nothing in common with Gary, I could feel his madness and sadness by
reading the book.</p>
<p>He is currently working to address wealth inequality. He is British,
and I hear that economic disparity is enormous in his country. To be
clear, he is only targeting the very, very, very wealthiest people, as
they are somehow evading taxes while the working class pays a massive
amount of taxes and cannot buy assets.</p>
<p>He argues that the price of assets, such as housees, keep rising, and
it sounds legitimate. Now, I’m wondering whether I should buy a home to
hedge against the situation, as the top companies are rapidly expanding
their assets and increasing the prices.</p>
<p>By the way, he spent his last two years as a Citibank trader in
Japan, and it was interesting to see Japanese restaurants or places I
know where mentioned in the book.</p>
<h2 id="csrf-cross-site-request-forgery">CSRF (Cross-Site Request
Forgery)</h2>
<p>CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack where a malicious site
tricks the browser of logged-in user into sending authenticated requests
to a target web applications. If the application users cookies to store
authentication credentials like JWTs, and proper CSRF protections (like
tokens or SameSite settings) are not in place, these requests can
perform unauthorized actions like triggering a money transfer.</p>
<p>One mechanism to prevent the attack is to require a random token,
known as a CSRF token, to validate requests. First, the backend
generates a random CSRF token and embeds it in the HTML form or sets it
in Cookies (if Cookies is used, it should not included in request
headers automatically by browsers).</p>
<p>Attackers cannot guess the CSRF token because it is random and
unique. They also cannot read it from the backend response because
browsers enforce the Same-Origin Policy, which blocks cross-origin sites
from accessing responses. Even if the CSRF token is included in an HTML
or JSON response, the browsers will prevent a malicious site from
reading it, unless the server explicitly weakens this protection using
permissive CORS headers like <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>
with <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true</code>.</p>
<p>SOP: security mechanism that restricts how a web page can interact
with resources from a different origin.</p>
<p>CORS: mechanism that allows servers to relax the restrictions imposed
by SOP.</p>
<p>Words: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), CSRF tokens, SOP (Same
Origin Policy), CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</p>

can run about 1 million basic steps per second</h2>
<p>I browsed some web pages and asked ChatGPT but could not find any
resources on that. However, all of my mentors use the number to estimate
the procesing time, so I will just go for it, I guess.</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 test.py
Elapsed: 0.04726767539978027
$ cat test.py
import time

start = time.time()
x = 0
for _ in range(1_000_000):
    x += 1
print(&quot;Elapsed:&quot;, time.time() - start)</code></pre>
<p>It seems the number is not far from reality.</p>
