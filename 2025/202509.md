I feel exhausted. Finally, it's time to take some break.

Running can distract my focus from all the other pressure for a short time. I now sense that why successful people run regularly: it is a way to sort of harm themselves (like wrist cut) to get distracted from stress.

- some research on Python syntactic sugar
	- Some people say `a == b` is syntactic sugar for `a.__eq__(b)`, e.g., Ramalho of Fluent Python and [Real Python - Syntactic Sugar: Why Python Is Sweet and Pythonic](https://realpython.com/syntactic-sugar-python/). Some people don't.

# 20250902

- full-time job
- 60 minutes run (hard)
- LeetCode 133. Clone Graph
	- browsed the discussion on the computer hardware in the study group
	- browsed [clock cycles of 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processor Family](https://www.intel.co.jp/content/www/jp/ja/content-details/679103/instruction-throughput-and-latency.html) by downloading the CSV file.
		- one instruction requires 1\~14 clock cycles :eyes:
		- Recent CPU has around 3 GHz frequency -> `3 * 10 ^ 9` clock cycles per second -> 3 clock cycles per 1 ns. Let's say a program's instructions cost 3 clock cycles on average -> 1 instruction per 1 nano second (with fast programming such as C++). However, Things are more complicated due to pipeline or concurrent instruction execution.
