# 20250904

- full-time job (very hard)
- did some research on Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
- stretches, push-ups

# 20250903

- LeetCode 133. Clone Graph
	- refined my recursive solution by avoiding lambda nested functions
		- My mentor says that it is rare to use nested functions in C++
	- updated my study note
- full-time job
- LeetCode 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
	- I guess it is a famous notation in computer science. I think I studied the advantage of the polish notation, but I don't exactly remember.
	- TIL: `std::to_string`, `std::stoi`, `switch () {` only works for `int`, `stack.top()` / `stack.pop()` (unlike Python's data structure, `pop()` does not return a value.).
- made an appointment for tire exchange
- stretches, push-ups

# 20250902

- full-time job
- 60 minutes run (hard)
- LeetCode 133. Clone Graph
	- browsed the discussion on the computer hardware in the study group
	- browsed [clock cycles of 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processor Family](https://www.intel.co.jp/content/www/jp/ja/content-details/679103/instruction-throughput-and-latency.html) by downloading the CSV file.
		- one instruction requires 1\~14 clock cycles :eyes:
		- Recent CPU has around 3 GHz frequency -> `3 * 10 ^ 9` clock cycles per second -> 3 clock cycles per 1 ns. Let's say a program's instructions cost 3 clock cycles on average -> 1 instruction per 1 nano second (with fast programming such as C++). However, Things are more complicated due to pipeline or concurrent instruction execution.
- stretches, push-ups

# 20250901

- some work for my full-time position
- LeetCode 133. Clone Graph
	- It is taking me some time to feel comfortable with C++ lambda syntax.
	- created a pull request to ask for reviews in the study group
