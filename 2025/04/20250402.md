# 20250402

Pull requests I created before going to bed kept my nerves stimulated by making me worry about reviews they would leave.

- full-time job (super hard)
	- I tried to wrap up tasks but could not finish them today. At least I made some progress.
- 20 minutes walk
- The Algebra of Wealth
- reviewed review comments
	- I'm glad that I get many feedback
- journaling
