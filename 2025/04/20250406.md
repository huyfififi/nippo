## Quick Look: Tail Call Optimization

[Tail recursion - HaskellWiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/index.php?title=Tail_recursion)

In imperative languages, recursive function calls typically build up the call stack, which can lead to high memory usage. Functional languages often support tail call optimization, allowing a specific type of recursive functions (tail-recursive ones) to execute without growing the call stack, making them more memory-efficient.
