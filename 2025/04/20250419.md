- brisk walk
- read "自分の変え方" by 村岡大樹
	- The author emphasizes the importance of exploring completely unexpected options and changing the rules of the game. I'm often old-fashioned and stubborn, so this advice really resonates with me.
	- He says it is OK to not see the concrete steps to achieve the goal. Invent on the way instead.
	- I don't feel the urge to completely change myself, since my life feels quite balanced right now, but it was still a good read.
