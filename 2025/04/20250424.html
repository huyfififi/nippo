- Data considerations for microservices</a></p>
<p>The first section gives me a broad understanding of how data
management works in a microservice setup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note It’s fine for services to share the same physical database
server. The problem occurs when services share the same schema, or read
and write to the same set of database tables.</p>

- Does Microservices architecture requires a database for each one
?</a></p>
<p>I love the tone of the top-voted answer—it provides a concise summary
of the issues with sharing common tables across multiple microservices,
while also acknowledging that it can be acceptable in real-world
scenarios.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microservices are architectural/design pattern, where services
are:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Independently deployable</li>
<li>Loosely coupled</li>
<li>Organized around business capabilities</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By having common tables you are violating all 3 of those properties,
because if you make breaking changes to table, you:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>need to deploy multiple unrelated microservices</li>
<li>microservices are now tightly coupled with DB model</li>
<li>multiple services serve same business domain.</li>
</ul>

- Pattern: Database per service</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep each microservice’s persistent data private to that service and
accessible only via its API. A service’s transactions only involve its
database.</p>
