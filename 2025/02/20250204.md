## MVC (Model-View-Controller)

[Model-view-controller - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
[MVC - MDN Web Docs Glossary ... - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC)

> It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance.

- Model: Manages data and business logic.
- View: Handles the UI (layout or display).
- Controller: Manages requests and business logic, acting as an intermediary between the Model and View.

It just makes sense to think Django as an MVC framework (though it may not be technically).
