<li>Designing Data-Intensive Applications
<ul>
<li>Detailed implementations or reasonings are a bit too difficult for
me now. I prioritize going through the book for now, and I will go back
to in-depth study later.</li>
<li>Linerizability is a consistency model that ensures a system behaves
as if there is only one copy of the data, with all operations applied
atomicaly in a single, globally consistent order. While making
distributed systems look as if a single-threaded program is appealing,
its performance drawbacks make it an impractical option.</li>
<li>Causal consistency offers a more practical alternative by ensuring
that operations that are causally related are observed in the same order
by all nodes, without enforcing a total global ordering. This allows for
better performance and scalability while still maintaining meaningful
consistency.</li>
<li>However, capturing causal relationships using mechanisms like
Lamport timestamps does not solve all coordination challenges,
particularly in cases requiring strong agreement. This leads to the need
for consensus algorithms to achieve a shared, reliable state across
distributed nodes.</li>
