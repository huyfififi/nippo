- commented on a GitHub issue my friend created
- chest press, lat pull down, kettle lift, arm curl, 15 minutes run
- Oath Ceremony
	- I became an U.S. citizen!!!
		- I feel relieved as I don't have to worry about the process anymore.
		- I feel negligible changes in my identity after getting U.S. citizenship; that might be because I have already experienced nationality changes before (Vietnamese -> Japanese), but I sure sense the feeling of being an American (sort of).
- worked hard
- journaling (zero second thinking)
- helped my friend debug research code
