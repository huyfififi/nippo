## test coverage threshold with `pytest-cov`

We have a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests and checks test coverage. I noticed that a run didn't fail even though it seemed like it should have at first glance.

The confusing part is that, it said "FAIL" in the result messages by `pytest-cov`, but did not exit with code 1 (Instead, we got exit code 0), which 

**When the task fails**

```
Run poetry run pytest --cov=. --cov-fail-under=72
FAIL Required test coverage of 72% not reached. Total coverage: 70.60%

Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

**When the task succeeds even though the test coverage is under the given value**

```
Run poetry run pytest --cov=. --cov-fail-under=71
FAIL Required test coverage of 71% not reached. Total coverage: 70.60%

# exit with code 0. thus, the GitHub Actions workflow does not fail.
```

I didn't have much time today to dive deep into the code base (sorry!), but it looks like the comparition is being made using the rounded value with the specified precision.

[pytest-cov/src/pytest\_cov/plugin.py](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/blob/4732d50f2322a6e0ea480a6c400fbc96f78283bb/src/pytest_cov/plugin.py#L380)

```
class CovPlugin:
    def pytest_terminal_summary(self, terminalreporter):
        if self.options.cov_fail_under is not None and self.options.cov_fail_under > 0:
            failed = self.cov_total < self.options.cov_fail_under
            message = '{fail}Required test coverage of {required}% {reached}. ' 'Total coverage: {actual:.2f}%\n'.format(
                required=self.options.cov_fail_under,
                actual=self.cov_total,
                fail='FAIL ' if failed else '',
                reached='not reached' if failed else 'reached',
            )
```

This condition in `pytest-cov` reports FAIL by comparing (unrounded?) coverage total and the given value for `--cov-fail-under`. However,

[coveragepy/coverage/results.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/1aecfa7ae2a81aa9c278cbb43718ae7e4bdcf5b5/coverage/results.py#L399)

```
def should_fail_under(total: float, fail_under: float, precision: int) -> bool:
    """Determine if a total should fail due to fail-under.

    `total` is a float, the coverage measurement total. `fail_under` is the
    fail_under setting to compare with. `precision` is the number of digits
    to consider after the decimal point.

    Returns True if the total should fail.

    """
    # We can never achieve higher than 100% coverage, or less than zero.
    if not (0 <= fail_under <= 100.0):
        msg = f"fail_under={fail_under} is invalid. Must be between 0 and 100."
        raise ConfigError(msg)

    # Special case for fail_under=100, it must really be 100.
    if fail_under == 100.0 and total != 100.0:
        return True

    return round(total, precision) < fail_under
```

The condition rounds the total test coverage, leading to the mismatch.

This might be related to this [issue #638](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/638)

Anyway, I'm glad I could find out what happened.
