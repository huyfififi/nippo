<h3 id="problems-in-distributed-systems">Problems in Distributed
Systems</h3>
<h4 id="unreliable-network">Unreliable Network</h4>
<p>Unlike phone lines, network communication does not guarantee reliable
delivery—packets can be lost in the middle or experience huge delay.
When a response is not received, the requester cannot know whether the
issue is due to a network failure or if the receiver is completely
down.</p>
<p>To ensure proper resource management in distributed systems—such as
promoting a new database leader—system failures must be detected. This
is typically achieved using timeouts. However, because optimal timeout
values vary depending on the infrastructure, they should be determined
empirically, as setting it too low confuses temporary network faults as
faults on the system side.</p>
<h4 id="unreliable-clocks">Unreliable Clocks</h4>
<p>Computer clocks are inherently unreliable due to hardware
limitations, and assuming clocks of distributed systems are in sync is
incorrect. For example, using timestamps to order database operations
might seem intuitive, but in practice, later operations can end up with
earlier timestamps due to clock drift or synchronization issues. (Last
Write Wins (LWW) is a common approach to resolve such conflicts, where
the operation with the most recent timestamp takes precendence, though
conflicts still can occur. When designing distributed systems, we should
be aware of those limitations and make decisions upon that).</p>
<h4 id="process-pauses">Process Pauses</h4>
<p>Proceses can occasionally pause, often due to system-level operations
like Garbage Collection (GC). The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is
particularly known for its GC-induced pauses, which can sometimes freeze
all running threads for several minutes. However, this issue is not
unique to Java—Python and many other languages also experience process
pauses due to garbage collection and other system operations.</p>
<p>In distributed systems, such pauses can lead to critical issues. For
example, in leader-based replication, a temporarily paused leader might
be incorrectly considered dead, causing the system to elect a new
leader. When the original leader resumes, they system may end up with
multiple leaders, leading to conflicts and inconsistencies.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-approach-the-problems">How to approach the problems</h3>
<p>In distributed systems, things can go wrong
<strong><em>partially</em></strong>. Many distributed systems approach
this problem by relying on a <em>quorum</em>; when most (this number is
configurable) nodes agree on something, it can be considered as true. In
most cases, the quorum is more than a half of the nodes.</p>
