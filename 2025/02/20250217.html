<p>Q. Why do we need TLS certificates to communicate over HTTPS while
computers can simply encrypt connections?</p>
<p>A. At a high level, we need a <strong>legitimate third
party</strong>—a <strong>Certificate Authority (CA)</strong>—to verify
the identities of computers (websites, servers, etc.) so that users can
trust they’re communicating with the intended entity and not an
imposter.</p>

<li>The author pointed out that the conventional explanation of the CAP
theorem picking two out of Consistency, Availability, and Partition
tolerance is misleading because partition is inevitable when a network
is involved. I only knew the concept of the CAP theorem, so the point of
view is new to me.</li>
