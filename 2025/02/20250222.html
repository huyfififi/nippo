<li>Designing Data-Intensive Applications
<ul>
<li>A system of record serves as a source of truth, where an
authoritative version of data resides. Its data is typically
normalized.</li>
<li>On the contrary, a derived system transforms the truthy data to
serve in many ways. One example is cache, where the copy of data is
stored for better performance. It seems to break the benefit of
normalized data; one piece of data is stored in only one place, but it
is needed for good performance or analysis in reality.</li>
