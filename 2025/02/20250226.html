Data-Intensive Applications - Chapter 9 - Consistency and Consensus</h2>
<h3 id="linearizability">Linearizability</h3>
<p>Linearizability makes a distributed system behave like a
single-threaded program, i.e., in a linearizable system, all operations
appear to be executed atomically on a single copy of the data, and their
effects are immediately visible to all subsequent operations in
real-time order. While this simple concept is appealing, achieving
linearizability is challenging because all nodes must agree on a global
order of oeprations, making the system susceptible to network delays and
failures.</p>
<h3 id="causality">Causality</h3>
<p>Causality is a weaker guarantee than linearizability. Unlike
linearizability, causal consistency does not enforece a global ordering
of operations but ensures that causally related operations are observed
in the correct sequence. That means when operation A depends on
operation B, the system ensures the operations’ causal order is
maintained. However, if operation C is independent of A and B, there is
no enforced ordering between them.</p>
<h3 id="cap-theorem-and-linearizability-vs-causality">CAP Theorem and
Linearizability vs Causality</h3>
<p>The CAP theorem presents the idea that ony two of consistency (C),
availability (A), and partition tolerance (P) can be achieved in a
distributed system. However, networks are inherently unreliable, making
partition tolerance (P) required. Therefore, we can prioritize either
consistency (C) or availability (A). (NOTE: The CAP theorem isn’t about
picking “two out of three”, but rather balancing trade-offs during
partitions.)</p>
<p>Linearizability corresponds to strong consistency, ensuring a single
globally ordered state. Causal consistency, while weaker than
linearizability, still maintains order among dependent operations. While
causal consistency can improve network fault tolerance compared to
strict linearizability, systems that fully prioritize availability often
prioritize causal consistency (eventual consistency), which imposes even
fewer ordering constraints (than linearizability).</p>
<h3 id="consensus-problem">Consensus Problem</h3>
<p>Even with the relaxed requirements of causal consistency, nodes in a
distributed system still need a mechanism to track and enforce causal
dependencies, which introduces coordination challenges similar to the
consensus problem. There are various approaches to coordinate
distributed systems, such as quorum-based mechanisms, versioning with
epoch numbers, and commit protocols like Two-Phase Commit (2PC).</p>
