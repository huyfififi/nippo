Q. Why do we need TLS certificates to communicate over HTTPS while computers can simply encrypt connections?

A. At a high level, we need a **legitimate third party**—a **Certificate Authority (CA)**—to verify the identities of computers (websites, servers, etc.) so that users can trust they're communicating with the intended entity and not an imposter.
