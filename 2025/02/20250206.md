- I passed the naturalization interview. Congratulations!
	- I'm not a U.S. citizen yet. I will be on 2/20 if things go smoothly
- I have been nervous about the interview. Now, I feel relieved and exhausted.

- slept a lot, trying to recover from the damage inflicted by the naturalization process
- I hope I can get back to my normal state, pursuing software engineering (as long as my body holds up)
