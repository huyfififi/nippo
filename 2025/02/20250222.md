- Designing Data-Intensive Applications
	- A system of record serves as a source of truth, where an authoritative version of data resides. Its data is typically normalized.
	- On the contrary, a derived system transforms the truthy data to serve in many ways. One example is cache, where the copy of data is stored for better performance. It seems to break the benefit of normalized data; one piece of data is stored in only one place, but it is needed for good performance or analysis in reality.
- cleared "Sonic Forces"
	- This is my first Sonic game, and the game experience was good.
	- Its original soundtrack is awesome.
	- It's fun to create my own sonic-like avater.
