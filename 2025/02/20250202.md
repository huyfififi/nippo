	- It was not a new idea for me that humans don't evolve much while society changes a lot, and the mismatch causes mental/physical issues. However, this book provided me with concrete and go-to approaches that I can try. I have already changed the wallpaper of my iPhone to a picture of a forest and ordered a probiotic supplement. I'm going to try other tips later, such as placing a plant on the working desk or evaluating what is important to my life.
