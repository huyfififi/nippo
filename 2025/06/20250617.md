# 20250617

- full-time job
	- As Iâ€™m moving into a more senior position, most of my work are now review tasks.
- called Wells Fargo Advisors. They were not helpful, and I'm thinking about switching my main bank.
- explored other solutions for LeetCode 67. Add Binary
	- `while a or b or carry:`
	- I know `issubclass(bool, int) is True`, but it is always surprising when I look at it.
	- `reversed()` and `rjust()`
