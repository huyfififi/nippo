Monday is always the most productive day of the week.

- discussed noise complaints with the apartment manager
- full-time job (!)
- reviewed 226. Invert Binary Tree
- got a copy of my 2022 tax return
- lat pull down, arm curl, 30 minutes jog
- LeetCode 67. Add Binary
	- I knew Python `int()` can take the second positional argument to specify "base"
	- `bin()[2:]`

---

TODO:

- check how many steps Python can take in a second
- check available facilities for passport request
