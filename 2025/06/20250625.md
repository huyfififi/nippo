I could not sleep well because I had many meetings last evening, and it stimulated my nerves.

- full-time job
- created a pull request: 543: Diameter of Binary Tree
- chest press, 30 minutes jog
	- I was about to throw up
- LeetCode 876. Middle of the Linked List (step 1, 2)
- checked the behavior of `id()`

```
In [1]: a, b = 'foobar', 'barbaz'

In [2]: a[:3] is b[:3]
Out[2]: False

In [3]: id(a[:3]) == id(b[:3])
Out[3]: True

In [4]: id(a[:3])
Out[4]: 4347335216

In [5]: id(b[:3])
Out[5]: 4347019760
```

[StackOverflow - Why does id({}) == id({}) and id([]) == id([]) in CPython? [duplicated]](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3877275/16193058)

When evaluating `id(a[:3]) == id(b[:3])`, the first `a[:3]` seems to be garbage collected before evaluating `id(b[:3])`, and `b[:3]` seems to use the same address (with CPython).
