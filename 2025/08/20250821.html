Instructions per cycle</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In computer architecture, instructions per cycle (IPC), commonly
called instructions per clock, is one aspect of a processor’s
performance: the average number of instructions executed for each clock
cycle. It is the multiplicative inverse of cycles per instruction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While early generations of CPUs carried out all the steps to execute
an instruction sequentially, modern CPUs can do many things in parallel.
As it is impossible to just keep doubling the speed of the clock,
instruction pipelining and superscalar processor design have evolved so
CPUs can use a variety of execution units in parallel – looking ahead
through the incoming instructions in order to optimise them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Old CPUs: Instructions took multiple cycles each.</li>
<li>Modern CPUs: Can run multiple instructions per cycle with complex
execution logic.</li>
</ul>

<p>They are mathematical inverses:</p>
<pre><code>IPC = 1 / CPI</code></pre>
<p>I searched for ICP/CPI of Apple, Intel, or NVIDIA chips, but they
don’t seem to disclose the metrics. I think I should consider CPI/IPC as
theoretical models or analytical tools, not as fixed values for modern
CPUs (as they can vary drastically depending on instructions or
workload).</p>

<p>It’s been 5 (or more years) since I saw the word “RISC” in college. I
know I should not use Wikipedia as a reference, but pardon me for
now.</p>
<p>From what I digested…</p>
<p>RISC is a CPU architecture style that strives to simplify the
instruction set so processors can run faster and more efficiently.
Modern performance gains in Apple’s M-series and most mobile processors
come from this philosophy.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_RISC_pipeline">Wikipedia -
Classic RISC pipeline</a></p>
<p>RISC’s simplicity of instructions made the 5-stage pipeline feasible
and efficient.</p>
<p>Classic RISC pipeline has 5 stages, and stages from different
instructions can overhap. A single instruction requires 5 stages
(cycles) to complete (latency), but because instructions can overlap,
CPU can complete one instruction per cycle (throughput). (Please refer
to the diagram on the Wikipedia page or other places; it can provide
visual understanding.)</p>
