recursion - HaskellWiki</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A recursive function is tail recursive if the final result of the
recursive call is the final result of the function itself. If the result
of the recursive call must be further processed (say, by adding 1 to it,
or consing another element onto the beginning of it), it is not tail
recursive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In many programming languages, calling a function uses stack space,
so a function that is tail recursive can build up a large stack of calls
to itself, which wastes memory. Since in a tail call, the containing
function is about to return, its environment can actually be discarded
and the recursive call can be entered without creating a new stack
frame. This trick is called tail call elimination or tail call
optimisation and allows tail-recursive functions to recur
indefinitely.</p>

- Tail Recursion - Functional Programming in OCaml</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A function is tail recursive if it calls itself recursively but does
not perform any computation after the recursive call returns, and
immediately returns to its caller the value of its recursive call.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But if you’re going to write functions on really long lists, tail
recursion becomes important for performance. Recall (from CS 1110) that
there is a call stack, which is a stack (the data structure with push
and pop operations) with one element for each function call that has
been started but has not yet completed. Each element stores things like
the value of local variables and what part of the function has not been
evaluated yet. When the evaluation of one function body calls another
function, a new element is pushed on the call stack and it is popped off
when the called function completes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When a function makes a recursive call to itself and there is nothing
more for the caller to do after the callee returns (except return the
callee’s result), this situation is called a tail call. Functional
languages like OCaml (and even imperative languages like C++) typically
include an hugely useful optimization: when a call is a tail call, the
caller’s stack-frame is popped before the call—the callee’s stack-frame
just replaces the caller’s. This makes sense: the caller was just going
to return the callee’s result anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So when you have a choice between using a tail-recursive
vs. non-tail-recursive function, you are likely better off using the
tail-recursive function on really long lists to achieve space
efficiency. For that reason, the List module documents which functions
are tail recursive and which are not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that a tail-recursive implementation is
strictly better. For example, the tail-recursive function might be
harder to read. (Consider sum_plus_acc.) Also, there are cases where
implementing a tail-recursive function entails having to do a pre- or
post-processing pass to reverse the list. On small to medium sized
lists, the overhead of reversing the list (both in time and in
allocating memory for the reversed list) can make the tail-recursive
version less time efficient.</p>

<p>A popular example of tail recursion seems to be a function to
calculate factorial.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> fact(n: <span class="bu">int</span>) <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="bu">int</span>:</span>

<p>The multiplication happens after the deeper call returns, so every
frame must stay on the stack to finish its pending * n operation.</p>
<p>To make it tail recursive, the function can be formed as</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> fact(n: <span class="bu">int</span>, accumulated: <span class="dv">1</span>) <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="bu">int</span>:</span>
