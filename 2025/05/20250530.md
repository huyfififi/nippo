I've been occupied with personal tasks and full-time job, and could not make progress on LeetCode (not only for interviews, but also for improving my coding skills).

- bank appointment
	- checked a check status
	- updated my name on my bank account
- built a bed frame and made a bed
- full-time job
	- `git rm --cache **/.project`
- cleaned the bathroom
- threw away the garbage
- mopped the entire room
- cleaned my car a bit
- chest press, 1-hour jog, lat pull down
