- BBQ
- Finished reading "The Algebra of Wealth"
	- The author's comical tone kept me hooked, and the last chapter was especially interesting, as it covers fundamental concepts like the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which help in understanding everyday finance.
- LeetCode 169 Majority Element (step 1: counter, heap, sort, quick select)
	- The space complexity of merge sort is O(n)
	- Browsed web pages on Quick Select
- consulted my friends about his search for a spouse

> Merge Sort does recursive splitting and merging:

> - The maximum number of elements being worked on (merged) **at any one time** is **bounded by n**, the size of the array.

> - Each level of recursion may allocate temporary arrays, but **these allocations don’t accumulate simultaneously** — older ones get discarded or reused.
