Data-Intensive Applications: Chapter 5 - Replication</h2>
<p>(It’s a bit embarrassing that I don’t have any experience managing
big (large amount of) data. Because of the lack of hands-on exposure,
the content of this book feels unfamiliar to me. Still, skimming it
should be helpful in the future, providing me with some starting points
for tackling data storage challenges.)</p>
<p>Replication is a technique to replicate data across multiple machines
to place data closer to users geographically, have some tolerance for
server down, and scale out the number of machines that serve for read
requests.</p>
<p>These are the main approaches for replication that the author
mentions in this chapter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-leader replication
<ul>
<li>Only the leader accepts write requests and propagates the latest
data to the read replicas (followers). If the leader becomes
unavailable, a failover occurs, and one of the followers is promoted to
leader.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Multi-leader replication
<ul>
<li>By extending the single-leader replication by having multiple
leaders, performance and availability can be improved. The major
downside of this approach is the necessity of handling conflicts of
write requests.</li>
<li>“It rarely makes sense to use a multi-leader setup within a single
datacenter, because the benefits rarely outweigh the added
complexity.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Leaderless replication (Dynamo-style)
<ul>
<li>Some approach data replication without the concepts of leaders,
letting clients send write/read requests to multiple nodes.</li>
<li>However, as I googled the replication approach, I noticed that it
seems unpopular in this industry.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>When replication happens asynchronously, a client may read outdated
data from an asynchronous follower. However, asynchronous followers
should catch up with their leader at some point, and the effect is
called eventual consistency.</p>
<p>Guarantees in leader-based replication</p>
<ul>
<li>Read-after-write consistency (also known as read-your-writes
consistency)
<ul>
<li>This guarantee ensures that users can immediately read the updates
they make rather than seeing outdated data after submitting those
updates.</li>
<li>One way to achieve this is to always read from the leader when
reading data that users may update.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Monotonic Reads
<ul>
<li>This guarantee ensures that read results don’t go backward
chronographically when a user makes multiple reads.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consistent Prefix Reads
<ul>
<li>This guarantee ensures that users read data in the same order as
writes occur.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
