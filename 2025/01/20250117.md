- contacted my family doctor
	- He said that he could not do anything about my skin issues anymore and he would ask some other specialists (for skin issues?).
- slept all day all night
- processed some documents for naturalization

I'm not a machine and cannot function 24/7; I sometimes need some distraction from work or other serious issues.

I know some people who work much harder than me. When I was younger, I tried to catch up with the pace, but I came to think that they are gifted with some good genetics, so I cannot replicate their work (I cannot deny that they work very hard, but it is also true that working hard is not something everyone can do innately).
