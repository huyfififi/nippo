## Cloudflare Tunnels

[Cloudflare Tunnels - Cloudflare Zero Trust Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)

> Cloudflare Tunnel provides you with a secure way to connect your resources to Cloudflare without a publicly routable IP address.

> Cloudflare Tunnel can connect HTTP web servers, SSH servers, remote desktops, and other protocols safely to Cloudflare.

Today, my friend set up a web server on her local PC. Since she doesn't have a static IP address, I assumed she was using `ngrok`, but I found out that Cloudflare provides a feature to create a tunnel directing requests to a domain. It's very convenient for a hobby project!
