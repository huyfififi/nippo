<li><em>write skew</em>: a race condition where multiple transactions
read the same objects and update some of them concurrently, leading to
an inconsistent state. In constrast, a dirty write or lost update occurs
when two transactions simultaneously read and update the same object,
resulting in one update being overwritten and lost.
<ul>
<li>For example, you can think of a meeting room booking system. When
two transactions that read bookings to ensure the the room is empty at a
specific time and add a new booking record occur almost at the same
time, both transactions may add their bookings that conflict. In this
case, simply getting a lock for a record to be updated is infeasible.
<ul>
<li>“This effect, where a write in one transaction changes the result of
a search query in another transaction, is called <em>phantom</em>”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>One way to address the issue is <em>materializing conflicts</em>,
which turns a phantom into a lock conflict by creating concrete set of
rows that can be dealt with a lock.
<ul>
<li>For example, we can create records (mtg room, time period)
beforehand, and use a lock when updating the records.</li>
<li>This is uncommon in reality because it’s difficult to think about
how to materialize conflicts.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>serializable</em> isolation: considered to be the strongest
isolation level
<ul>
<li>“It guarantees that even though transactions may execute in
parallel, the end result is the same as if they had executed one at a
time, <em>serially</em>, without any concurrency.”</li>
