- Zero Second Thinking
	- I reconfirmed that I mostly care about my goals or feelings and don't pay much attention to what others think about me (as long as it is not important to my social/professional life). The only reason I want social status (to some extent) is to help people who helpmed me along the way, and if it were not for them, I would be happy setting my own goals and pursuing them without much recognition from others. I'm a human, so I need *some* appreciation or recognition, though.

## `whois`

My friend faced an issue with domain registrar and he used `whois` command to diagnose the issue. Let's check `DomainStatus`.

```
$ whois zlxa.xyz

> clientHold

> This status code prevents your domain from being transferred from your current registrar to another. It is an uncommon status that is usually enacted during legal or other disputes, at your request, or when a redemptionPeriod status is in place.

> serverTransferProhibited

> This status code tells your domain's registry to not activate your domain in the DNS and as a consequence, it will not resolve. It is an uncommon status that is usually enacted during legal disputes, non-payment, or when your domain is subject to deletion.

As the status messages suggest, the next action he might be going to take is to contact the domain name registrar `onamae.com` as they are not something we have control.
