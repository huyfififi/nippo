## Designing Data-Intensive Applications: Chapter 5 - Replication

(It's a bit embarrassing that I don't have any experience managing big (large amount of) data. Because of the lack of hands-on exposure, the content of this book feels unfamiliar to me. Still, skimming it should be helpful in the future, providing me with some starting points for tackling data storage challenges.)

Replication is a technique to replicate data across multiple machines to place data closer to users geographically, have some tolerance for server down, and scale out the number of machines that serve for read requests.

These are the main approaches for replication that the author mentions in this chapter.

- Single-leader replication
	- Only the leader accepts write requests and propagates the latest data to the read replicas (followers). If the leader becomes unavailable, a failover occurs, and one of the followers is promoted to leader.
- Multi-leader replication
	- By extending the single-leader replication by having multiple leaders, performance and availability can be improved. The major downside of this approach is the necessity of handling conflicts of write requests.
	- "It rarely makes sense to use a multi-leader setup within a single datacenter, because the benefits rarely outweigh the added complexity."
- Leaderless replication (Dynamo-style)
	- Some approach data replication without the concepts of leaders, letting clients send write/read requests to multiple nodes.
	- However, as I googled the replication approach, I noticed that it seems unpopular in this industry.

When replication happens asynchronously, a client may read outdated data from an asynchronous follower. However, asynchronous followers should catch up with their leader at some point, and the effect is called eventual consistency.

Guarantees in leader-based replication

- Read-after-write consistency (also known as read-your-writes consistency)
	- This guarantee ensures that users can immediately read the updates they make rather than seeing outdated data after submitting those updates.
	- One way to achieve this is to always read from the leader when reading data that users may update.
- Monotonic Reads
	- This guarantee ensures that read results don't go backward chronographically when a user makes multiple reads.
- Consistent Prefix Reads
	- This guarantee ensures that users read data in the same order as writes occur.
