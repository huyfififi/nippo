Data-Intensive Applications - Chapter 6 - Partitioning</h2>
<p>Whereas replication is all about having multiple copies of the same
data for better response time or availability, partitioning is a
technique to split a massive amount of data into smaller groups for
scalability.</p>
<h3 id="partitioning-key-value-data">Partitioning Key-Value Data</h3>
<p>There are two main approaches to partitioning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Partitioning by Key Range
<ul>
<li>This approach partitions data with continuous key ranges. For
example, data are partitioned into two parts; one is for keys between
“a” to “m” and the other for “n” to “z” lexicographically.</li>
<li>The advantage of this approach is that we can perform range queries
efficiently.</li>
<li>The disadvantage of this is that data may create hot spots. For
example, when using timestamp as a key, all writes for a day will direct
to the same partition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Partitioning by Hash of Key
<ul>
<li>This approach partitions data with the hash values of keys so that
data are distributed evenly.</li>
<li>Range queries cannot be performed.</li>
<li>It’s unlikely to have hot spots since (key, data) are distributed
fiarly among the partitions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="secondary-indexes-in-partitioning">Secondary Indexes in
Partitioning</h3>
<p>It’s uncommon for users to search for specific data only with primary
keys, so it’s natural to have secondary indexes. There are two
approaches to this.</p>
<ul>
<li>local index (document-partitioned)
<ul>
<li>Each partition maintains secondary indexes of its data, i.e., a
partition has no information about secondary indexes of other
partitions.</li>
<li>Clients need to query all partitions to retrieve all results if the
results of secondary indexes are scattered across multiple
partitions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>global index (term-partitioned)
<ul>
<li>Each partition maintains some of secondary indexes for all data so
that clients only need to query one partition to get data of an
index.</li>
<li>Writes need to propagate for all partitions so that their secondary
indexes include the newly added records.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, document-partitioned is good at processing writes,
whereas term-partitioned is good at reading.</p>
<h3 id="rebalancing">Rebalancing</h3>
<p>When adding a new node to have more data, the partitions must be
rebalanced. Because we are dealing with a massive amount of data, we
should minimize the moves of data in partitions; otherwise, we will
experience an excessive amouint of loads on the system.</p>
<p>We cannot simply calculate mod N for partitioning because increasing
the number of nodes moves a large amount of data in partitions. Let’s
say we have a record with key = 10 and N = 5. At first, the record
resides in partition 0 (10 mod 5), but after increasing the number of
nodes, the record will be moved to partition 4 (10 mod 6). This type of
move is inevitable and frequent with this approach.</p>
<h4 id="fixed-number-of-partitions">Fixed number of partitions</h4>
<p>There is a simple mitigation to reduce the volume of data moved: have
many more partitions from the beginning than the actual number of nodes.
With this approach, each node is assigned many partitions, such as 100
partitions. When a new node is added, each existing partition provides
the new node with some of its partitions. Though, it’s difficult to
choose the number of partitions.</p>
<h4 id="dynamic-partitioning">Dynamic partitioning</h4>
<p>When using key range partitioning, some flexibility about the number
of partitions in a node is beneficial, avoiding hot spots. One approach
is to configure a threshold for the number of records in a partition and
divide/merge partitions to follow the configuration.</p>
<h4 id="manual-rebalancing-vs-automatic-rebalancing">Manual Rebalancing
vs Automatic Rebalancing</h4>
<p>Fully automating rebalancing may lead to an undesired situation. For
example, when the system experiences high loads, some of the nodes are
unavailable, and this may trigger rebalancing, which puts more loads on
the system. Therefore, it’s a rule of thumb to make some steps require
manual reviews/operations.</p>
<h3 id="request-routing">Request Routing</h3>
<p>There are several ways to let clients know which partition to make
queries, and the most popular one is to have a separate coordination
service.</p>
<p>Clients send requests to the service, and it replies with the
knowledge of which partition clients should send requests next.</p>
