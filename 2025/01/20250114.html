<h2 id="taking-breaks">Taking Breaks</h2>
<p>Yesterday, I suddenly sweated a lot even though I did not feel hot.
This type of body malfunction happened sometime recently, but it was the
worst one. I rushed to bed and fell asleep yesterday.</p>
<p>As I mulled over my life, I tended to use all of my power to achieve
goals. It was a greedy approach; I did my best to achieve the short-term
goal, hoping the actions would also be good for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>It’s like trying to sprint every 100 m in a full marathon. It’s
obvious that it does not work.</p>
<p>The approach provided me with some achievements, but I suffered a lot
mentally and now physically. It worked to some extent when I was
younger, but I think I need to reconsider my attitude toward my life in
general.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to understand what kind of rest works for me, but at
least I weigh breaks more now.</p>
<p>(You won’t swim any faster by simply moving your limbs as forcefully
as possible. You need to learn the proper technique to convert your
strength into forward movement.)</p>
