- Designing Data-Intensive Applications
	- A *replication topology* in multi-leader replication depicts how writes are propagated from one node to another.
		- There are several types of such topologies, including circular topology, star topology, and all-to-all topology. all-to-all topology seems to be the most popular one.
	- In addition to single-leader and multi-leader replication, there is an approach to have no leaders at all. The leaderless replication is called *Dynamo-style*.
		- I cannot find many resources about the origin of *Dynamo* and *Dynamo-style* online.
		- Let's say we configure `n` replicas, `w` nodes to confirm a write operation, and `r` nodes to confirm a read operation.
			- When writing a record, success responses from `w` nodes will be considered as success as a whole system
			- When reading a record, success responses from `r` nodes will be considered as success as a whole and the node with the latest data will be used.
			- As long as `w + r > n`, the system can tolerate unavailable nodes
				- `r > n - w` <=> `r` is at least `n - w + 1`. Because at least `w` nodes have the latest data, `r >= n - w + 1` always contain at least one node with the latest data.
