<h2 id="denormalization">Denormalization</h2>
<p>There are two major types of databases: relational databases such as
PostgreSQL and document databases such as MongoDB.</p>
<p>When working with relational databases, normalization is usually
recommended to reduce redundancy and make it easier to handle data.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have these records in <code>Employees</code> table</p>
<h3 id="employees">Employees</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>email</th>
<th>department</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>Kazuki Kijima</td>
<td>kk@example.com</td>
<td>R&amp;D</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>Huy Nguyen</td>
<td>hn@example.com</td>
<td>Sales</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>Gilbert Blythe</td>
<td>gb@example.com</td>
<td>R&amp;D</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The common example I see in books/lectures is to consider a scenario
to update the department fields R&amp;D -&gt; Engineering. If we keep
data in this way, we need to iterate through all records and apply the
update. In this example, we need to update records with id = 1 and id =
3.</p>
<p>Normalization comes in play here to extract the shared information
and transfer it to another table.</p>
<h3 id="employees-1">Employees</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>email</th>
<th>department_id</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>Kazuki Kijima</td>
<td>kk@example.com</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>Huy Nguyen</td>
<td>hn@example.com</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>Gilbert Blythe</td>
<td>gb@example.com</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="departments">Departments</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>R&amp;D</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>Sales</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, if we think about updating R&amp;D -&gt; Engineering, we just
need to update one record in <code>Departments</code> table, leaving
<code>Employees</code> records untouched.</p>
<p>One piece of information resides in one place. It’s neat, right?</p>
<p>Document databases tend to be used with a very different perspective
on this; they encourage redundancy.</p>
<p>The problem with normalized relational data is that we need to query
multiple tables to gather information (using multiple JOIN). This can be
mitigated by having some redundancy and not avoiding storing the same
data in multiple places.</p>
<p>To think about the example above, combining <code>Employees</code>
table and <code>Departments</code> table into one can remove the need to
join two different tables when reading. This can improve performance,
and because we do the opposite operation to normalization, it’s called
denormalization.</p>
<p>It’s beneficial under some scenarios, e.g., the entire document is
used every time you render a web page, but write operations will cost
much more.</p>

strictly speaking)</p>
