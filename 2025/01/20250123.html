<li>Zero Second Thinking
<ul>
<li>I reconfirmed that I mostly care about my goals or feelings and
don’t pay much attention to what others think about me (as long as it is
not important to my social/professional life). The only reason I want
social status (to some extent) is to help people who helpmed me along
the way, and if it were not for them, I would be happy setting my own
goals and pursuing them without much recognition from others. I’m a
human, so I need <em>some</em> appreciation or recognition, though.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>clientHold</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This status code prevents your domain from being transferred from
your current registrar to another. It is an uncommon status that is
usually enacted during legal or other disputes, at your request, or when
a redemptionPeriod status is in place.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>serverTransferProhibited</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This status code tells your domain’s registry to not activate your
domain in the DNS and as a consequence, it will not resolve. It is an
uncommon status that is usually enacted during legal disputes,
non-payment, or when your domain is subject to deletion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the status messages suggest, the next action he might be going to
take is to contact the domain name registrar <code>onamae.com</code> as
they are not something we have control.</p>
