I will take some breaks this week

- sent a message to the insurance agent
- Zero Second Thinking
- read "パーティーが終わり、中年が始まる"
	- Everything's vivid when we are young, but as we get older, the picture lose colors.
	- The balance of what I can relate to and the author's new perspective is incredible.
- (Civics Questions)
