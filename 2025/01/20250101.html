<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<li>In a multi-leader replication setup, writes can conflict. Various
methods exist to resolve these conflicts, and one of them is known as
<em>last write wins (LWW)</em>, which may lead to data loss.</li>

<h2 id="goals">2025 Goals</h2>
<p>2024 was a productive year in which I participated in many
competitive programming contests (compared to 2023), tried free-lancing
to get more experience, worked hard for my full-time job regarding AI
technologies, contributed some OSS projects (creating issues and pull
requests), read many books including technical ones, and, most
importantly, managed to survive. - I was thinking about hiring a coach
for competitive-programming, but as I see some improvements, I will
resume my current practice for some time.</p>
<p>Because I’m still in an unstable position as an immigrant and there
are too many uncontrollable in my life, I don’t want to impose any
strict goals for 2025. However, here are some objectives I want to
achieve if possible. I’ll do my best, but I don’t guarantee the
outcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate in Codeforces contests once a month</li>
<li>Bring back my six-packs (I started a new subscription for a diet
application today)</li>
<li>Get one star on GitHub
<ul>
<li>Keep considering an OSS project</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Continue reading books and papers</li>
<li>Survive</li>
</ul>
