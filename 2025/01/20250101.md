Happy New Year!

- Designing Data-Intensive Applicartions
	- In a multi-leader replication setup, writes can conflict. Various methods exist to resolve these conflicts, and one of them is known as *last write wins (LWW)*, which may lead to data loss.

## 2025 Goals

2024 was a productive year in which I participated in many competitive programming contests (compared to 2023), tried free-lancing to get more experience, worked hard for my full-time job regarding AI technologies, contributed some OSS projects (creating issues and pull requests), read many books including technical ones, and, most importantly, managed to survive.
	- I was thinking about hiring a coach for competitive-programming, but as I see some improvements, I will resume my current practice for some time.

Because I'm still in an unstable position as an immigrant and there are too many uncontrollable in my life, I don't want to impose any strict goals for 2025. However, here are some objectives I want to achieve if possible. I'll do my best, but I don't guarantee the outcome.

- Participate in Codeforces contests once a month
- Bring back my six-packs (I started a new subscription for a diet application today)
- Get one star on GitHub
	- Keep considering an OSS project
- Continue reading books and papers
- Survive
