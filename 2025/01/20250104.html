<blockquote>
<p>Hint 1 You can ignore all contestants with a rating lower than yours;
this does not affect the answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kevin’s <em>rank</em> is one plus the number of participants who
solve more problems than he does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, participants with lower (or equal?) rating than Kevin is
irrelevant in this problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hint 2 You are the contestant with the lowest rating, so any problem
you can solve can also be solved by everyone else. Thus, your ranking in
a competition only depends on the easiest problem you cannot solve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should have thought of these simplifications first.</p>
<p>By using these constraints, sorting problems and performing a binary
search to find the easiest problem Kevin cannot solve for each
<code>k</code> might be the solution. Let’s wait for my brain for some
tiem to sort out the content and try implementing it later.</p>
