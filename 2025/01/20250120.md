# 20250120

I realized today is a federal holiday as I arrived at the office. (worked on some tasks tho)

The date of the naturalization interview is approaching. I am slowing down my study about programming for a bit and directing resources to the interview.

I'm reluctant to join the Lunar New Year party hosted by my uncle.
