<li>A <em>replication topology</em> in multi-leader replication depicts
how writes are propagated from one node to another.
<ul>
<li>There are several types of such topologies, including circular
topology, star topology, and all-to-all topology. all-to-all topology
seems to be the most popular one.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In addition to single-leader and multi-leader replication, there is
an approach to have no leaders at all. The leaderless replication is
called <em>Dynamo-style</em>.
<ul>
<li>I cannot find many resources about the origin of <em>Dynamo</em> and
<em>Dynamo-style</em> online.</li>
<li>Letâ€™s say we configure <code>n</code> replicas, <code>w</code> nodes
to confirm a write operation, and <code>r</code> nodes to confirm a read
operation.
<ul>
<li>When writing a record, success responses from <code>w</code> nodes
will be considered as success as a whole system</li>
<li>When reading a record, success responses from <code>r</code> nodes
will be considered as success as a whole and the node with the latest
data will be used.</li>
<li>As long as <code>w + r &gt; n</code>, the system can tolerate
unavailable nodes
<ul>
<li><code>r &gt; n - w</code> &lt;=&gt; <code>r</code> is at least
<code>n - w + 1</code>. Because at least <code>w</code> nodes have the
latest data, <code>r &gt;= n - w + 1</code> always contain at least one
node with the latest data.</li>
