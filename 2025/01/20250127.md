## Manually Triggering Dependabot Updates

Problem: GitHub Actions is relatively unstable, and it is totally possible that scheduled dependency updates fail.

Re-running a failed job to update dependencies does not trigger a dependency check.

```
Run github/dependabot-action@main
🤖 ~ starting update ~
Warning: Dependabot workflows cannot be re-run. Retrigger this update via Dependabot instead.
🤖 ~ finished: nothing to do ~
```

I need to navigate to

Insights -> Dependency graph -> Dependabot -> recent update jobs -> Check for updates

to re-trigger the dependency checks
