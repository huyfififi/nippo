> Hint 1
> You can ignore all contestants with a rating lower than yours; this does not affect the answer.

The problem says

> Kevin's *rank* is one plus the number of participants who solve more problems than he does.

Therefore, participants with lower (or equal?) rating than Kevin is irrelevant in this problem.

> Hint 2
> You are the contestant with the lowest rating, so any problem you can solve can also be solved by everyone else. Thus, your ranking in a competition only depends on the easiest problem you cannot solve.

I should have thought of these simplifications first.

By using these constraints, sorting problems and performing a binary search to find the easiest problem Kevin cannot solve for each `k` might be the solution. Let's wait for my brain for some tiem to sort out the content and try implementing it later.
