	- The implementation of snapshot isolation
		- I might want to skip the details
		- to achieve read-committed, previous values are stored. To support snapshot isolation, multi-version of values are stored. In the sense, the implementation of snapshot isolation is considered as an extension of the implementation of the read-commited.
		- Because snapshot isolation maintains several versions of an object side by side, this technique is known as *multi-version concurrency control* (MVCC).
