	- It's getting harder and harder to digest the contents
	- Read Commited: no *dirty reads*, no *dirty writes*

		- Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI): Contrary to Two-Phase Locking, transactions continue anyway, and the database checks if they cause problems when they are commited. They will be aborted if the checks fail. checks afterwards
