## Rehabilitation: [2063A. Minimal Coprime - 800](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2063/A)

The problem description is too difficult for me to digest, but looking at the samples provided me with the solution.

`[n, n + 1] (n >= 2)` is *coprime*.

> if `n` and `n + 1` are not coprime, `n = km`, `n + 1 = lm` (l and m are integers, m >= 2), but `(n + 1) - n = 1 = (l - k)m` => contradiction.

`[1, 1]` is *coprime* because they share only one positive common divisor `1`. (That makes [1, 2] not coprime).

When `l >= 2`, coprimes in `[l, r]` are `[l, l + 1]`, `[l + 1, l + 2]`, ..., `[r - 1, r]`, and the count is `r - l`.

When `l == 1`, coprimes in `[l, r]` are `[1, 1]`, [2, 3]`, `[3, 4]`, ..., `[r - 1, r]`, and the count is also `r - l (r >= 2)` .

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if l == r == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    print(r - l)
```
