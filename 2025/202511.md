- set up the reminder app of iOS to remind me of weighing myself every morning
- LeetCode 1. Two Sum (C++, brute-force, sorting + two pointers, hash map)
	- I thought I was done with this problem, but sometimes I faced C++ syntax issues or simple logical issues. It's embarrassing but I believe I'm making progress.
	- `<utility> std::pair`
	- When using the optimization option such as `-O1`, `i++` and `++i` seem to result in the same assembly. However, when dealing with objects like iterators, postincrement adds overhead copying the previous value. preincrement is always more efficient than postincrement, so it's better to use preincrement.
