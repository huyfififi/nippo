### LeetCode 14. Longest Common Prefix

I could simplify the while loop in yesterday's solution, but the name `check_index` is confusing. I will try to come up with a better name tomorrow.

The problem is that i used the name `check_index` to mean that `[:check_index]` has already been checked, and `[check_index + 1:]` is still pending. But the meaning breaks around incremenet/return operations.

```
#include <string>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    string longestCommonPrefix(std::vector<std::string>& strs) {
        size_t check_index = 0;
        bool matched = true;
        while (matched) {
            char matching_char = '\0';
            for (std::string str : strs) {
                if (str.size() <= check_index) {
                    matched = false;
                    break;
                }
                if (matching_char == '\0') {
                    matching_char = str[check_index];
                    continue;
                }
                if (str[check_index] != matching_char) {
                    matched = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            ++check_index;
        }
        return strs[0].substr(0, check_index - 1);
    }
};
```

### LeetCode 58. Length of Last Word

```
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(std::string s) {
        int non_space_count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (s[i] == ' ') {
                if (i + 1 < s.size() && s[i] != s[i + 1] ) {
                    non_space_count = 0;
                }
                continue;
            }

            ++non_space_count;
        }

        return non_space_count;
    }
};
```

	- I thought I was done with this problem, but sometimes I faced C++ syntax issues or simple logical issues. It's embarrassing but I believe I'm making progress.
	- `<utility> std::pair`
	- When using the optimization option such as `-O1`, `i++` and `++i` seem to result in the same assembly. However, when dealing with objects like iterators, postincrement adds overhead copying the previous value. preincrement is always more efficient than postincrement, so it's better to use preincrement.
