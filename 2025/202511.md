- weight: 81.5 kg
- cancelled a dental appointment
- full-time job
	- managed to complete tasks while I don't feel very well
	- I'm glad that a demo session succeeded
- LeetCode 20. Valid Parentheses, C++, std::string, I tend to forget declaring a type for std::stack
- LeetCode 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists, `.` for object itself, `->` for a pointer to access members

# 20251109

I didn't feel well (cough), so I took some rest

- weight: 80.9 kg
- Pho

# 20251108

- weight: 80.4 kg
- household chores
- LeetCode 20. Valid Parentheses, C++, std::stack
- 15 minutes jog
- picture drawing

# 20251107

- weight: 80.3 kg
- full-time job
	- It's... endless
- LeetCode 14. Longest Common Prefix
	- Ultimately, coding is about turning manual labor into programs, and I still have some room for improvement in that area.
- LeetCode 1. Two Sum, C++, `std::invalid_argument`, brute-force, map, sorting + two pointers 
- LeetCode 20. Valid Parentheses, std::stack, stack.push(), stack.pop(), stack.top()

# 20251106

- weight: 80.7 kg
- full-time job
- Pokemon Rank Match
- 15 minutes jog, chest press, lat pull

# 20251105

- weight: 80.7 kg
- full-time job (super hard)
	- I learned the hard way that AI does very well on a single, well-defined task, but its accuracy drops drastically when handling general or multiple tasks.
- LeetCode 1. Two Sum, C++, double for loops, hash map, sorting + two pointers
- LeetCode 9. Palindrome Number, C++, std::string, std::to_string()
- 15 minutes jog

# 20251104

- weight: 80.5 kg
- LeetCode 1. Two Sum (C++, sorting + two pointers, brute-force, hash map)
	- C++ structured binding `auto [identifier1, identifier2, ...] = expression;`
	- getting familiar with `std::tuple` and `std::pair`
	- `emplace_back()` forwards the arguments to the constructor
- full-time job
	- I'm tired of reviewing tasks
- 15 minutes jog, chest press, lat pull

# 20251103

- set up the reminder app of iOS to remind me of weighing myself every morning
- LeetCode 1. Two Sum (C++, brute-force, sorting + two pointers, hash map)
	- I thought I was done with this problem, but sometimes I faced C++ syntax issues or simple logical issues. It's embarrassing but I believe I'm making progress.
	- `<utility> std::pair`
	- When using the optimization option such as `-O1`, `i++` and `++i` seem to result in the same assembly. However, when dealing with objects like iterators, postincrement adds overhead copying the previous value. preincrement is always more efficient than postincrement, so it's better to use preincrement.
