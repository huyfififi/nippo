## [2044E. Insane Problem - 1300](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2044/E)

[Codeforces Round 993 (Div. 4) Editorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/137306)

It's not feasible to check all pairs of `x` and `y` because it takes O(n^2) time, but it's possible for `n`. Even with the most strict case `k=2`, we only need to check `n = 1, 2, 3, ..., 32 (2 ^ 32 = 4294967296 > 10 ^ 9)`.

Once `n` is fixed, we can simply count the intersection of two conditions.

```
for i in range(int(input())):
    k, l1, r1, l2, r2 = map(int, input().split())

    kn, ans = 1, 0

    while r2 // kn >= l1:
        # count the integer points in the intersection of
        # A. l1 <= x <= r1
        # B. ceil(l2 / k^n) <= x <= floor(r2 / k^n)
        # upper bound: min(r1, floor(r2 / k^n))
        # lower bound: max(l1, ceil(l2 / k^n))
        ans += max(
            0,
            min(r2 // kn, r1) - max((l2 - 1) // kn + 1, l1) + 1,
        )
        kn *= k

    print(ans)
```

In general, you can count the number of integer points in the intersection `A and B`, which is

```
max(0, min(upper bounds) - max(lower bounds) + 1)
```

It looks too obvious once I get to know the technique.

TIL

- Some variables in a problem can be brute-forced if their range is small.
- Counting the number of integer points in the intersection of two intervals is straightforward once I know the bounds.
