## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

[https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)

> The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

> The Model Context Protocol is an open source project run by Anthropic, PBC. and open to contributions from the entire community.

> MCP has the potential to function as a universal interface, think of it as the virtual / software version of USB-C for AI. Enabling seamless, secure and scalable data exchange between LLMs/AI Agents and external resources.

I'm not quite sure about the protocol, but I sense that people are working together to create a standard for LLM. Right now, APIs are different for each provider, so as end-users, it is good news.
