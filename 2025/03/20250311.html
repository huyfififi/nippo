Data-Intensive Applications - Chapter 10 - Batch Processing</h2>
<p>(I don’t have first-hand experience with batch processing or
MapReduce, so I will just remember the word “MapReduce” for future
reference and skip understanding its details.)</p>
<p>MapReduce is a common framework for batch processing in a distributed
system that takes input data and generates output data. It consists of
two components: the mapper, which applies a specific function to each
record, and the reducer, which gathers and processes the mapped
data.</p>
<p>MapReduce follows the same principle as UNIX pipes (while UNIX pipes
work with streams of data) in that it is deterministic and allows
chaining by directing the output of one MapReduce stage to the next.</p>
<p>UNIX commands and pipes are designed to run on a single machine,
whereas MapReduce is built for distributed systems, splitting tasks
across multiple mappers and leverage resources in multiple systems.</p>

<p>I can see some examples on the documentation. It seems Java is the
most common programming language that supports MapReduce.</p>

<p>There is also a Python API to Apache Spark that provides API to
leverage the MapReduce programming model.</p>
