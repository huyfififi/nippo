## Feb 2025

- I made it through February
	- under intense pressure to keep my job and take care of various tasks; otherwise, I wouldn't be able to bring my wife to the United States (I still need to endure for several months :cry:).
- I explored some resources to stay healthy and tried
	- reduced carbohydrates
	- ordered a plant (Pothos, haven't received it yet, will check if it actually affects my mental health this month)
- I exercised regularly (run, workout)
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications Chapter 8 & 9
- household chores
- **I became an American**
- TurboTax (haven't filed tho)
- Everyday Journaling

I didn't do many things last month, but I'm proud to have achieved some critical milestones.
