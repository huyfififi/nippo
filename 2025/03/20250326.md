I couldn't sleep much as thoughts about my work stimulated my nerves, but I'm glad I'm feeling alright for now.

## TIL: How to check leap years

I thought `year mod 4 == 0` was enough, but I was wrong. It's interesting to know that there are more complicated rules on it.

[cpython/Lib/calendar.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/4b3d5b604210f68005ef64d5346ca169385f5acf/Lib/calendar.py#L143)

```
def isleap(year):
    """Return True for leap years, False for non-leap years."""
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)
```

[web.archive.org - Introduction to Calendar](https://web.archive.org/web/20190613115330/http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php)

> The Gregorian leap year rule is: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is.
