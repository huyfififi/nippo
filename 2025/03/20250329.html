<h2 id="browsing-pep8-style-guide-for-python-code">Browsing <a
href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/">PEP8 — Style Guide for Python
Code</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising
the standard library in the main Python distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many projects have their own coding style guidelines. In the event of
any conflicts, such project-specific guides take precedence for that
project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m a bit surprised that they don’t strongly recommend PEP8 for
everyday programming as it just says they are used in the standard
library, while I feel most Python developers mindlessly follow them.</p>
<p>However, I think it’s worth following them to keep code clean and
readable because there should be reasons Guido and others created this
style guide.</p>
<h3 id="indentation">Indentation</h3>
<pre><code># Correct:

# Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest.
def long_function_name(
        var_one, var_two, var_three,
        var_four):
    print(var_one)

# Wrong:

# Further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable.
def long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two, var_three,
    var_four):
    print(var_one)</code></pre>
<p>I didn’t know about this formatting. I usually use
<code>black</code>, and with it, the definition becomes usually</p>
<pre><code>def long_function_name(
   var_one, var_two, var_three, var_four
):
   print(var_one)</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>def long_function_name(
    var_one,
    var_two,
    var_three,
    var_four,
):</code></pre>
<p>I’m so used to it that I feel more comfortable with the
<code>black</code>’s style. I only see the <code>black</code>’s pattern,
so I’m not very sure which is more common nowadays.</p>
<h3 id="maximum-line-length">Maximum Line Length</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original version of PEP8 was created in 2001, and I think this
suggestion is obsolete as people nowadays use wide windows that are not
limited to 80 characters width that has a historical reason.</p>
<p><code>black</code> set 88, and I see many projects use 120 as the
maximum line length.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some teams strongly prefer a longer line length. For code maintained
exclusively or primarily by a team that can reach agreement on this
issue, it is okay to increase the line length limit up to 99 characters,
provided that comments and docstrings are still wrapped at 72
characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>:thinking_face: From my (limited) experience, modern Python code
don’t strictly follow the guidance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python’s implied
line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sometimes see the overuse of backslashes that don’t look great. I
might want to cite this in the future.</p>
<h3 id="should-a-line-break-before-or-after-a-binary-operator">Should a
Line Break Before or After a Binary Operator?</h3>
<pre><code># Wrong:
# operators sit far away from their operands
income = (gross_wages +
          taxable_interest +
          (dividends - qualified_dividends) -
          ira_deduction -
          student_loan_interest)

# Correct:
# easy to match operators with operands
income = (gross_wages
          + taxable_interest
          + (dividends - qualified_dividends)
          - ira_deduction
          - student_loan_interest)</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>In Python code, it is permissible to break before or after a binary
operator, as long as the convention is consistent locally. For new code
Knuth’s style (*mentioned as the correct one aove) is suggested.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="imports">Imports</h3>
<pre><code># Correct:
import os
import sys

# Wrong:
import sys, os</code></pre>
<p>I didn’t know that I can do <code>import lib1, lib2, lib3, ...</code>
as this is the first time I see this pattern. I may be too young to know
the historical development of the Python community.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Imports should be grouped in the following order: &gt; 1. Standard
library imports. &gt; 2. Related third party imports. &gt; 3. Local
application/library specific imports. &gt; You should put a blank line
between each group of imports.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Absolute imports are recommended…However, explicit relative imports
are an acceptable alternative to absolute imports…Standard library code
should avoid complex package layouts and always use absolute
imports.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Wildcard imports (from &lt;module&gt; import *) should be avoided,
as they make it unclear which names are present in the namespace,
confusing both readers and many automated tools.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="module-level-dunder-names">Module Level Dunder Names</h3>
<p>This section reminds me of the use of <code>__all__</code>. It
slipped out of my mind.</p>
<h3 id="whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements">Whitespace in
Expressions and Statements</h3>
<h4 id="pet-peeves">Pet Peeves</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Between a trailing comma and a following close parentheses:</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># Correct
foo = (0,)

# Wrong
bar = (0, )</code></pre>
<p><code>flake8</code> and <code>ruff</code> does not raise errors for
it, but <code>black</code> fixes the wrong style. :thinking_face:</p>
<h4 id="other-recommendations">Other Recommendations</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding
whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies). Use your
own judgment;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># Correct:
hypot2 = x*x + y*y

# Wrong:
hypot2 = x * x + y * y</code></pre>
<p>I was not aware of this pattern. I think I should remember.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use spaces around the = sign when used to indicate a keyword
argument, or when used to indicate a default value for an unannotated
function parameter:…When combining an argument annotation with a default
value, however, do use spaces around the = sign:</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># Correct:
def munge(sep: AnyStr = None): ...

# Wrong:
def munge(input: AnyStr=None): ...</code></pre>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Python coders from non-English speaking countries: please write your
comments in English, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never
be read by people who don’t speak your language.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="naming-conventions">Naming Conventions</h3>
<h4 id="descriptive-naming-styles">Descriptive: Naming Styles</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, the following special forms using leading or trailing
underscores are recognized (these can generally be combined with any
case convention):</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>_single_leading_underscore: weak “internal use” indicator. E.g. from
M import * does not import objects whose names start with an
underscore.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>single_trailing_underscore_: used by convention to avoid conflicts
with Python keyword, e.g. :
<code>tkinter.Toplevel(master, class_='ClassName')</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>My mentor pointed out this on my pull request.</p>
<h4 id="priscriptive-naming-conventions">Priscriptive: Naming
Conventions</h4>
<h5 id="names-to-avoid">Names to Avoid</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Never use the characters ‘l’ (lowercase letter el), ‘O’ (uppercase
letter oh), or ‘I’ (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable
names.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the
numerals one and zero. When tempted to use ‘l’, use ‘L’ instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="global-variable-names">Global Variable Names</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Modules that are designed for use via <code>from M import *</code>
should use the <code>__all__</code> mechanism to prevent exporting
globals…</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="function-and-method-arguments">Function and Method
Arguments</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>If a function argument’s name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is
generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than use
an abbreviation or spelling corruption. Thus class_ is better than clss.
(Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a synonym.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="method-names-and-instance-variables">Method Names and Instance
Variables</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to
invoke Python’s name mangling rules. …Generally, double leading
underscores should be used only to avoid name conflicts with attributes
in classes designed to be subclassed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: there is some controversy about the use of __names (see
below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm… interesting</p>
<h5 id="designing-for-inheritance">Designing for Inheritance</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>…Note 1: Try to keep the functional behavior side-effect free,
although side-effects such as caching are generally fine…Note 2: Avoid
using properties for computationally expensive operations; the attribute
notation makes the caller believe that access is (relatively) cheap.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your class is intended to be subclassed, and you have attributes
that you do not want subclasses to use, consider naming them with double
leading underscores and no trailing underscores. This invokes Python’s
name mangling algorithm, where the name of the class is mangled into the
attribute name. This helps avoid attribute name collisions should
subclasses inadvertently contain attributes with the same name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember I had some discussion on these points.</p>
<h4 id="public-and-internal-interfaces">Public and Internal
Interfaces</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Any backwards compatibility guarantees apply only to public
interfaces. Accordingly, it is important that users be able to clearly
distinguish between public and internal interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To better support introspection, modules should explicitly declare
the names in their public API using the <code>__all__</code> attribute.
Setting <code>__all__</code> to an empty list indicates that the module
has no public API.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="programming-recommendations">Programming Recommendations</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Code should be written in a way that does not disadvantage other
implementations of Python (PyPy, Jython, IronPython, Cython, Psyco, and
such).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t know many of the implementations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…For example, do not rely on CPython’s efficient implementation of
in-place string concatenation for statements in the form
<code>a += b</code> or <code>a = a + b</code>. This optimization is
fragile even in CPython (it only works for some types) and isn’t present
at all in implementations that don’t use refcounting. In performance
sensitive parts of the library, the <code>''.join()</code> form should
be used instead. This will ensure that concatenation occurs in linear
time across various implementations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Also, beware of writing <code>if x</code> when you really mean
<code>if x is not None</code> – e.g. when testing whether a variable or
argument that defaults to None was set to some other value. The other
value might have a type (such as a container) that could be false in a
boolean context!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I encountered this pitfall for some times in my life.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Derive exceptions from Exception rather than BaseException. Direct
inheritance from BaseException is reserved for exceptions where catching
them is almost always the wrong thing to do.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions whenever
possible instead of using a bare <code>except:</code> clause: …A bare
<code>except</code>: clause will catch SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt
exceptions, making it harder to interrupt a program with Control-C, and
can disguise other problems. If you want to catch all exceptions that
signal program errors, use <code>except Exception</code>: (bare except
is equivalent to <code>except BaseException:</code>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t know that a bare <code>except:</code> will catch SystemExit
and KeyboardInterrupt.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Additionally, for all try/except clauses, limit the try clause to
the absolute minimum amount of code necessary. Again, this avoids
masking bugs:</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I always adovocate this, but it seems beginner Python developers tend
to have a very broad try-except clause.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>''.startswith()</code> and <code>''.endswith()</code>
instead of string slicing to check for prefixes or suffixes.
startswith() and endswith() are cleaner and less error prone:</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Object type comparisons should always use isinstance() instead of
comparing types directly:</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty
sequences are false:</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember I got a review comment about these guides.</p>
<p>Tada! :tada: I finished reading through PEP8. It was worth it to
re-visit style guides I was about to forget.</p>
