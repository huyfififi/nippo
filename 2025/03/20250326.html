<h2 id="til-how-to-check-leap-years">TIL: How to check leap years</h2>
<p>I thought <code>year mod 4 == 0</code> was enough, but I was wrong.
It’s interesting to know that there are more complicated rules on
it.</p>

<pre><code>def isleap(year):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return True for leap years, False for non-leap years.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>The Gregorian leap year rule is: Every year that is exactly divisible
by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by
100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly
divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not
leap years, but the year 2000 is.</p>
