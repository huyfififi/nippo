I woke up 5 am today. Now, I'm sleepy at 9 am.

- scheduled a 1:1 MTG
- journaling
	- My dream has already come trueâ€”having a beautiful and thoughtful wife, a full-time job as a programmer, and some time to read books. I don't need anything more (though I do find it challenging to maintain this state).
- Learning the vi and Vim Editors
- Dependabot
- 20 minutes walk
- Go programming
- full-time job
	- I'm tired.
