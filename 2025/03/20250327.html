<blockquote>
<p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables
seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources
and tools. Whether you’re building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat
interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized
way to connect LLMs with the context they need.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Model Context Protocol is an open source project run by
Anthropic, PBC. and open to contributions from the entire community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MCP has the potential to function as a universal interface, think of
it as the virtual / software version of USB-C for AI. Enabling seamless,
secure and scalable data exchange between LLMs/AI Agents and external
resources.</p>

<p>I’m not quite sure about the protocol, but I sense that people are
working together to create a standard for LLM. Right now, APIs are
different for each provider, so as end-users, it is good news.</p>
