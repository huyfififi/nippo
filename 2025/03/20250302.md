- 30 minutes walk
- helped my friend pick up his new car, a Lexus RX 500h
	- I have no interest in practicing a lavish lifestyle, but I do agree that Lexus cars look great.
- lunch with my friend
	- I should have avoided carbohydrates for lunch. I'm so sleepy that I cannot focus on tasks
	- Conversations with my friends make me more aware of our differences and my own biases(?)
- journaling
	- My friend wants to be like Luffy while I want to be like Mihawk
	- I want to go where I want with my maximum agility
		- I don't like to be slowed down to collaborate with others
- 50 minutes walk, chest press, 20 minutes run (not to fall asleep)
	- I'm maxing out the chest press machine. My chest is so strong.
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications
	- There are several approaches to perform joins in MapReduce; some of them are map side joins and reduce side joins

I'm too sleepy... I wish I could be more productive, but anyway, being healthy is the highest priority
