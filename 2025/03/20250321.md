- I took a shower as I will have several social events today.
- read [https://blog.pco2699.net/entry/2024/01/30/070011](https://blog.pco2699.net/entry/2024/01/30/070011)
- 1 on 1 with Hiro
	- We concluded that I should have a short-term goal that is crystal clear and motivates me (for some time). Competitive programming or technical books have not entertained me for a long time, so I will explore other options that are not too difficult (by reading books or talking with my developer friends).
- Team Outing
	- I had been avoiding carbohydrates, but the pizza at the team outing spiked my blood sugar, leading to a serious dip in my health and an insatiable apetite.
- stopped by my friend's place (for 5 minutes)
