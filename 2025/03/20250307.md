# 20250307-20250309

The stress of a full-time job, the market, relationships, and networking got to me, and I could not do anything productive this weekend.

That happens sometimes, and I don't think it can be avoided, given my physical condition and circumstances.

- journaling
- slept a lot
- ate a lot
- read "しないことリスト" by pha
- watched "Sonic the Hedgehog 3"
