Data-Intensive Applications - Chapter 12 - The Future of Data
Systems</h2>
<p>Because the author covers many topics in this chapter, I won’t
summarize the content. Instead, I’ll make some notes on the topics I was
able to understand (at least to some extent).</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly often I see software engineers make statements like, “In
my experience, 99% of people only need X” or “…don’t need X” (for
various values of X). I think that such statements say more about the
experience of the speaker than about the actual usefulness of a
technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I usually avoid making bold statements, but I must admin that I tend
to criticize the overuse of NoSQL. I don’t have much experience with
databases, so the message made me think I should be more neutral about
such things.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The beauty of such a gradual migration is that every stage of the
process is easily reversible if something goes wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think a similar concept is mentioned as the strangler pattern in
<em>The Art of Readable Code</em>. When migration from an old function
to a new one, you can keep both for a while. Once all usages of the old
function are removed, it is safe to delete it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Lambda architecture combines batch processing for the periodic
computation of accurate values with stream processing for the real-time
approximation of values.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hadoop is an open-source framework for distributed storage and
processing of large datasets across clusters of computers.</p>
<p>It consists of multiple components, with the Hadoop Distributed File
System (HDFS) being the file storage system within Hadoop.</p>
<hr />
<p>A materialized view is a precomputed and stored result of a query,
acting as a cache to improve performance. Unlike regular views, it does
not dynamically reflect changes in the underlying data unless it is
refreshed.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>As I said in the Preface, building for scale that you don’t need is
wasted effort and may lock you into an inflexible design.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is a single technology that does everything you need, you’re
most likely best off simply using that product rather than trying to
reimplement it yourself from lower-level components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, I didn’t overengineer anything personally, but I’ve seen
many teams build unnecessarily massive systems. That said, I understand
that, at times, managers need to accommodate vanity requirements to keep
engineering teams busy.</p>
<hr />
<p>There has been a trend toward separating stateless application logic
from stateful databases. One advantage of this separation is that it
allows independent scaling.</p>
<hr />
<p>Although challenging, making operations idempotent helps mitigate
concerns about duplicate records. One way to achieve this is by
including a request ID in INSERT or UPDATE operations. If a client
accidentally sends the same request multiple times, the unique
constraint on the request ID in the database ensures that only the first
request is processed.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In slogan form: violations of timeliness are “eventual consistency,”
whereas violations of integrity are “perpetual inconsistency.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In practice, some level of data inconsistency may be acceptable. For
example, if a customer is charged twice, the issue can be resolved by
apologizing and issuing a refund. It is crucial to assess how much
inconsistency your business can tolerate.</p>
<hr />
<p>The author mentions his experience with hardware corruption and bugs
in database software. Although very rare, it’s important to keep in mind
that they are totally possible.</p>
