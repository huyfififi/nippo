# 20240910

I found a bug in my dashboard [dashboard.huyfififi.com](dashboard.huyfififi.com) that my rating and contest counts are not updated correctly. I need to debug it.

First, I will trigger the background job manually and see if it raises some errors, but because I have many meetings today, I don\'t think I can dig it deeper now.

## [2008D. Sakurako's Hobby - 1000](https://codeforces.com/contest/2008/problem/D)

Because the input array is a permutation, meaning that each node has exactly one pointer to an other node. And, that means if `pj` is reachable from `pi`, they share the same `F(i)` (the number of black integers that are reachable from `i`).

My approach is to perform search for each loop and make them point to the same `F(i)` object. If a node is already visited, we will skip searching its result, so the time complexity is around O(n).

```
from typing import Optional


class Group:
    def __init__(self, bn: int = 0):
        self.black_count: int = bn


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    p: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b: list[bool] = [True if x == "1" else False for x in input()]

    p: list[tuple[int, bool]] = list(zip(p, b))

    ans: list[Optional[Group]] = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if ans[i] is not None:
            continue

        val, blk = p[i]
        g = Group(bn=(0 if blk else 1))
        ans[i] = g

        j = val - 1
        while ans[j] is None:
            dst_val, dst_blk = p[j]
            g.black_count += 0 if dst_blk else 1
            ans[j] = g
            j = dst_val - 1

    ans = [str(g.black_count) for g in ans]
    print(" ".join(ans))
```

This problem is tagged as `dsu`, which I have never heard of before. TODO: check the editorial and what is `dsu` (Disjoint Set Union?)
