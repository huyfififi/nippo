<p>I got a weird error running a workflow in GitHub Actions</p>
<pre><code>Error response from daemon: Head &quot;https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/postgres/manifests/16-alpine&quot;: unauthorized: incorrect username or password</code></pre>
<p>I googled it, but could not find any relevant web pages. Somehow,
retrying after 20 minutes worked. Very Strange.</p>
<p>The other day, Dependabot would not perform actios such as
rebasing.</p>
<p>Those kinds of anomalies seem to happen from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="repository-design-pattern">Repository Design Pattern</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I left GoF at my parents' house and cannot check it.
Instead, I browsed some web pages.</p>
<p>I'm forced to decode Java code and had some doubts on the design
pattern. There are so many Repository classes that some of my brain
cells were killed instantly.</p>
<p>As a Python programmer, it's kind of rare to encounter this
pattern.</p>

Design Pattern - GeeksforGeeks</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Repository Design Pattern is a software design pattern that acts
as an intermediary layer between an application's business logic and
data storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Its primary purpose is to provide a structured and standardized way
to access, manage, and manipulate data while abstracting the underlying
details of data storage technologies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This pattern promotes a clear separation of concerns, making software
more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to changes in data sources,
without entangling the core application logic with data access
intricacies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In essence, the Repository Design Pattern is a blueprint for
organizing and simplifying data access, enhancing the efficiency and
flexibility of software systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="advantages-of-repository-design-pattern">Advantages of
Repository Design Pattern</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized Data Access</strong>: The pattern centralizes
and abstracts adata access logic, allowing the rest of application to
interact with data through a consistent interface. This simplifies code
maintenance by managing all data-related operations in one place.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Testability</strong>: Separating data access logic
from the business logic facilitates easier unit testing. With a clear
interface for data operations, mocking or substituting the repository
makes it simpler to test other parts of the application
independently.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds familiarâ€¦ I feel that Dependency Injection's advantage is
the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve Code maintenability</strong>: The repository design
pattern promotes clean code by isolating data access logic. This
separation allows developers to make changes or optimize data access
without affecting the rest of the application.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reusability and Extensibility</strong>: By adhering to the
repository contract, multiple parts of the application can reuse the
same data access methods. It allows for easy addition of new data
sources or technologies without having to change the main logic of the
application.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="disadvantages-of-repository-design-pattern">Disadvantages of
Repository Design Pattern</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overhead for Simple Applications</strong>: Implementing the
repository design pattern might introduce unnecessary complexity in
smaller or straightforward applications. In such cases, the added layers
of abstraction might be more cumbersome than beneficial.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Curve and Development Time</strong>: Adopting the
repository design pattern might require additional time for development,
as it involves creating interfaces, defining contracts, and implementing
concrete repository classes. This learning curve could impact project
timelines.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Potential Abstraction Leaks</strong>: In some cases, the
repository design pattern might leak underlying implementation details
to higher layers, making the abstraction less effective. This can happen
if the repository needs to cater to complex queries or operations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="use-cases-for-repository-design-pattern">Use Cases for
Repository Design Pattern</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Applications</strong>: Repositories are commonly used in
web applications to manage data access to databases. They abstract the
interaction with the database and make it easier to switch to a
different database system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs and Services</strong>: When building APIs or
microservices, the Repository Pattern can help manage data access in a
clean and organized way. It enables multiple services to interact with
data consistently.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It just makes sense. I now remember all the patterns with Python.</p>
<h3 id="example-with-fastapi">Example with FastAPI</h3>
<p>In FastAPI, it is a very common pattern to have intermediate
functions whose responsibility is to read data from database.</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template/blob/master/backend/app/crud.py">fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template</a></p>
<p>For example, functions to CRUD user records are defined in
<code>crud.py</code>.</p>
<pre><code>def create_user(*, session: Session, user_create: UserCreate) -&gt; User:
    db_obj = User.model_validate(
        user_create, update={&quot;hashed_password&quot;: get_password_hash(user_create.password)}
    )
    session.add(db_obj)
    session.commit()
    session.refresh(db_obj)
    return db_obj


def get_user_by_email(*, session: Session, email: str) -&gt; User | None:
    statement = select(User).where(User.email == email)
    session_user = session.exec(statement).first()
    return session_user</code></pre>
<p>Now, the functions are used in creating API endpoints</p>
<pre><code>@router.post(
    &quot;/&quot;, dependencies=[Depends(get_current_active_superuser)], response_model=UserPublic
)
def create_user(*, session: SessionDep, user_in: UserCreate) -&gt; Any:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Create new user.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    user = crud.get_user_by_email(session=session, email=user_in.email)
    if user:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400,
            detail=&quot;The user with this email already exists in the system.&quot;,
        )

    user = crud.create_user(session=session, user_create=user_in)
    if settings.emails_enabled and user_in.email:
        email_data = generate_new_account_email(
            email_to=user_in.email, username=user_in.email, password=user_in.password
        )
        send_email(
            email_to=user_in.email,
            subject=email_data.subject,
            html_content=email_data.html_content,
        )
    return user</code></pre>
<p>By doing this, it's easier to test the API endpoint because we only
need to mock <code>crud.get_user_by_email()</code>. If we write db logic
in the API endpint, it would be a nightmare to mock.</p>
<p>Also, we can improve portability; now we only need to update the
database operations in repositories when migrating to a new database. I
don't think it often happens tho.</p>
