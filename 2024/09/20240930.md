I couldn\'t sleep last night.

Time flies.

The OpenAI Python client generated by [Stainless](https://www.stainlessapi.com/) works perfectly, but one thing to complain about is that they push too many releases. Sometimes, they have two releases a day.

- Browsed [Google Tech Blog: Less Is More: Principles for Simple Comments](https://testing.googleblog.com/2024/08/less-is-more-principles-for-simple.html)
	- It\'s interesting that they offer a one-page printer-friendly version of the blog that I can print out and hang on the wall of the bathroom.
	- I think I have already followed the suggestions in the blog.
- Guided my friend on the usage of Git.
- Browsed 20 questions of the Naturalization Test.

## Retry [2008A. Sakurako's Exam](https://codeforces.com/contest/2008/problem/A)

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0:
        if b % 2 == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
    elif a % 2 == 1:
        print("NO")
    # b % 2 does not matter if a >= 2
    # b % 2 == 0 -> distribute ones and twos evenly
    # b % 2 == 1 -> [1, 1, A], [2, A] where A is an array of ones and twos
    else:
        print("YES")
```
