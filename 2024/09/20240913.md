# 20240913 \~ 20240922: Vacation

I spent time with my wife.

- Processed documents for naturalization
- Went to Winchester Mystery House
- Went to IHOP
- Went on hiking at Almaden Quicksilver
	- and went to Country Inn (Eggs benedict was tasty)
- ...and more!

To be honest, I was bored killing time during vacation. I understand vacations are important for mental/physical health in the long run, but I can\'t wait to go back to coding.

The bug with my dashboard seems to be not possible to reproduce. The web app is working fine now, so I will leave it as it is for now.
