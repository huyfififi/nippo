<p>One of our project uses OSS with AGPL, but I was not confident it was
OK to use it for commercial purposes, so I browsed some websites about
the license.</p>
<p>It turned out that, AGPL forces me to make my code public if I modify
the original software, but I don't need to when just using it without
modifications.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I misunderstood.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s common for developers to think software licensing requirements
are the express responsibility of the legal department. With so many
open source components available and the implications of the licensing
requirements, every developer should have at least a general
understanding of what these licenses are and how each can affect their
software.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Considering the downstream implications a project can run into, every
team needs to review all license requirements for their software. Before
releasing any updated or modified software, organizations need to
conduct a complete license compliance audit, and doing this during every
stage of the project can avoid issues in the future. One license teams
should look into is the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).</p>

<p>A joint project between IBM, MIT, and Digital Equipment Corporation
(DEC) in 1983 seems to be the origin of the MIT license. The reason it
only seems to be the start is that there were multiple different
versions used at varying times with changes to the exact text.</p>

<p>The primary terms and conditions of the MIT license are to grant
permissions and indemnify developers for future use. Specifically, it
grants any person who obtains a copy of the software and associated

sublicense, and sell copies of the software.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-agpl">What is AGPL?</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Before discussing the AGPL license, it’s important to understand
where it comes from. In 1988, Richard Stallman wrote his General Public
License (GPL) aimed at enshrining the rights of creators to keep their
software open source at all times. GPL is currently in its third version
(GPLv3) due to issues with the previous text that created some
loopholes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of GPLv3, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) provided two
additional types of licenses, namely the Lesser General Public License
(LGPLv3) and the Affero General Public License (AGPLv3). The AGPL
version of the General Public License aims to enforce full copyleft
rights on all software that use it.</p>

id="what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-the-agpl-license">What
are the advantages and disadvantages of the AGPL license?</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the standard GPL license, the reciprocity clause comes into effect
whenever a developer releases software. The copyleft principle intends
to make all of the source code available to the wider open source
community. With AGPL, software teams can ensure all changes to the
codebase becomes available to the public, even on server-side
applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With AGPL, software teams can ensure all changes to the codebase
becomes available to the public, even on server-side applications…?
:thinking_face:</p>
<p>Does that mean we can keep our code base private as long as we don't
make changes to the software? continuing reading the web page to
clarify.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="some-of-the-advantages-of-the-agpl-include">Some of the
advantages of the AGPL include:</h4>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Forces teams to consider their licensing philosophy early in the
project and live with their decision.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ensures that any code snippet developed by the open source community
stays available and prevents others from repackaging and selling
open-source software.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-disadvantages-of-the-agpl-are">The disadvantages of the AGPL
are:</h4>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Puts some teams off open-source packages as it forces all other code
to become GPLed software.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Some view it as excessive as any module in any dependent package
that uses AGPL makes all other software subject to similar
restrictions.</li>

<h3 id="can-companies-use-agpl-software">Can companies use AGPL
software?</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Although anyone can use the AGPL V3 license, it’s not popular with
organizations. The restrictions placed on any subsequent versions of
AGPL software make it difficult to adopt when there are competing
commercial interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most companies prefer to use permissive licenses that give them the
freedom to use open source components and still turn their version of
the software into a commercial product in the future, as opposed to when
they use a copyleft license like AGPL.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="can-you-use-agpl-with-closed-source-applications">Can you use
AGPL with closed source applications</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The AGPL V3 license is a strong copyleft license that enforces open
source on all components derived from any previous work. It closes the
server-side loophole, where the source code isn't made available if the
software isn't released. AGPL defines a user as anyone who accesses the
server-side application if it is public-facing. For applications that
reside inside the organization's network, AGPL does not trigger the
release of the source code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's still confusing, but my current understanding is that, any
modifications of a SGPL-licensed software need to be public. However,
when using the software without any modifications, I'm not forced to
make the code public.</p>
<p>The reason companies usually don't choose AGPL-licensed software
might be because they cannot clone/fork the project and make
modifications privately.</p>
<p>For now, I think we don't have to take any actions for our
project.</p>
