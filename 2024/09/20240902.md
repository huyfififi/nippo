# 20240902

- Renewed the certificate for my Mastodon instance
	- The Nginx configuration is too complicated for me to tweak, and I don\'t have time/motivation to configure `certbot` with it...
- TIL: I need to add GitHub Actions secrets to `Dependabot` in addition to `Actions` to let workflows triggered by Dependabot pull requests use the secrets.

The author of [xavctn/img2table](https://github.com/xavctn/img2table) never responds to any issues or accepts pull requests from others. They just pushed the latest release yesterday without any notices, and it pissed me off. The lack of communication is unpleasant and unacceptable. One of our archaic code uses it, and I\'m trying to replace it due to the lack of communication and the lack of serveillance; there are no blockers on the author from doing something malicious/wrong.
