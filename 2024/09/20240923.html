Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures by Roy
Thomas Fielding</h2>
<p>From my understanding, there are no definitive definitions of RESTful
API, though there are some guidelines proposed by Roy Fielding and
accumulated best practices. (send me an email or create a pull request
to crrect me)</p>
<p>Reading Roy Fielding's dissertation offered me some insights, but
it's been a long time already, and I completely forgot what I understood
:sweat: This is a retry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CHAPTER 5: Representational State Transfer (REST)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This chapter introduces and elaborates the Representational State
Transfer (REST) architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems,
describing the software engineering principles guiding REST and the
interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, while
contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this chapter, the author explains REST by adding constraints one
by one.</p>
<h3 id="client-server">Client-Server</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The first constraints added to our hybrid style are those of the
client-server architectural style…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Separation of concerns is the principle behind the client-server
constraints. By separating the user interface concerns from the data
storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface
across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the
server components. Perhaps most significant to the Web, however, is that
the separation allows the components to evolve independently…</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="stateless">Stateless</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We next add a constraint to the client-server interaction:
communication must be stateless in nature, as in the
client-stateless-server (CSS) style…, such that each request from client
to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand
the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the
server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This constraint induces the properties of visibility, reliability,
and scalability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Visibility is improved because a monitoring system does not have to
look beyond a single request datum in order to determine the full nature
of the request.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reliability is improved because it eases the task of recovering from
partial failures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Scalability is improved because not having to store state between
requests allow the server component to quickly free resources, and
further simplifies implementation because the server doesn't have to
manage resource usage across requests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Like most architectural choices, the stateless constraint reflects a
design trade-off.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The disadvantage is that it may decrease network performance by
increasing the repetitive data (per-interaction overhead) sent in a
series of requests, since that data cannot be left on the server in a
shared context.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, placing the application state on the client-side reduces
the server's control over consistent application behavior, since the
application becomes dependent on the correct implementation of semantics
across multiple client versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cache">Cache</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to improve network efficiency, we add cache constraints to
form the client-cache-stateless-server style… Cache constraints require
that the data within a response to a request be implicitly or explicitly
labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. If a response if cacheable, then
a client cache is given the right to reuse that response data for later,
equivalent requests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I only have experience with Django and FastAPI, but I cannot think of
any real-life implementations having a flag to indicate a response is
cacheable or not. I guess I should do some research on it.</p>
<h3 id="uniform-interface">Uniform Interface</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style
from other network-based styles is its emphasis on a uniform interface
between components. By applying the software engineering principle of
generality to the component interface, the overall system architecture
is simplified and the visibility of interaction is improved.
Implementations are decoupled from the services they provide, which
encourages independent evolvability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades
efficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form
rather than one which is specific to an application's needs. The REST
interface is designed to be efficient for large-grain hypermedia data
transfer, optimizing for the common case of the Web, but resulting in an
interface that is not optimal for other forms of architectural
interaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple architectural
constraints are needed to guide the behavior of components. REST is
defined by four interface constraints: identification of resources;
manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive
messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These constraints will be discussed in Section 5.2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess it derives the common RESTful API structure such as the
common patterns of GET / or PUT /{id}, but I'm not totally sure.</p>
<h3 id="layered-system">Layered System</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to further improve behavior for Internet-scale requirements,
we add layered system constraints… the layered system style allows an
architecture to be composed of hierarchical layers by constraining
component behavior such that each component cannot “see” beyond the
immediate layer with which they are interacting. By restricting
knowledge of the system to a single layer, we place a bound on the
overall system complexity and promote substrate independence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Layers can be used to encapsulate legacy services and to protect new
services from legacy clients, simplifying components by moving
infrequently used functionality to a shared intermediary. Intermediaries
can also be used to improve system scalability by enabling load
balancing of services across multiple networks and processors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary disadvantage of layered systems is that they add overhead
and latency to the processing of data, reducing user-perceived
performance. For a network-based system that supports cache constraints,
this can be offset by the benefits of shared caching at
intermediaries…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The combination of layered system and uniform interface constraints
induces architectural properties similar to those of the uniform
pipe-and-filter style (Section 3.2.2). Although REST interaction is
two-way, the large-grain data flows of hypermedia interaction can each
be processed like a data-flow network, with filter components
selectively applied to the data stream in order to transform the content
as it passes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I better check out pipe-and-filter style. I don't quite understand
this part.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within REST, intermediary components can actively transform the
content of messages because the messages are self-descriptive and their
semantics are visible to intermediaries.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="code-on-demand">Code-On-Demand</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The final addition to our constraint set for REST comes from the
code-on-demand style of Section 3.5.3… REST allows client functionality
to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets
or scripts. This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features
required to be pre-implemented. Allowing features to be downloaded after
deployment improves system extensibility. However, it also reduces
visibility, and thus is only an optional constraint within REST.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>… For example, if all of the client software within an organization
is known to support Java applets, then services within that organization
can be constructed such that they gain the benefit of enhanced
functionality via downloadable Java classes. At the same time, however,
the organization's firewall may prevent the transfer of Java applets
from external sources, and thus to the rest of Web it will appear as if
those clients do not support code-on-demand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An optional constraint allows us to design an architecture that
supports the desired behavior in the general case, but with the
understanding that it may be disabled within some contexts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not very familiar with Java or applets right now, and don't
understand this constraint quite well. I will skip this for now and come
back here after some time. I hope I have relevant information in my
brain and can understand this part.</p>
