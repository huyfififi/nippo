<ul>
<li>Ordered running vest/shorts/shirts on Amazon</li>
<li>Checked the code of PyMuPDF
<ul>
<li>How they manage flags is interesting. They use an integer, and all
different flags are assigned 1, 2, 4, 8, …, so the flags can be combined
easily and managed effectively.</li>
<li>If I were to design that, I might have created some kind of object.
It was good to know.</li>

<p>I hope I can wake up a bit early tomorrow to go for a jogging.</p>
<h2 id="b.-square-or-not"><a

Not</a></h2>
<p>My approach:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Check if it's possible to make a square with the given number of
blocks</li>
<li>If it's possible, create the expected string and compare it with the
input</li>
</ol>
<p>It just worked, but I didn't use the constraint</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second line of each test case contains the string <code>s</code>
of length <code>n</code>. The string is always the result of writing out
the strings of a beautiful matrix.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>def root(n: int) -&gt; int:
    li: int = 0
    ri: int = n
    while li &lt; ri - 1:
        mi: int = (li + ri) // 2
        sq: int = mi * mi
        if sq == n:
            return mi
        elif sq &gt; n:
            ri = mi
        else:
            li = mi

    return li if li * li == n else -1


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    s: str = input()

    r = c = root(n)
    if r == -1:
        print(&quot;No&quot;)
        continue

    sq: str = &quot;&quot;
    sq += &quot;1&quot; * r
    for i in range(r - 2):
        sq += &quot;1&quot; + &quot;0&quot; * (r - 2) + &quot;1&quot;
    sq += &quot;1&quot; * r

    if s == sq:
        print(&quot;Yes&quot;)

<blockquote>
<p>Assume that string was created from the beautiful binary matrix with
size <code>r * c</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If <code>r &lt;= 2</code> or <code>c &lt;= 2</code>, then the whole
matrix consists of ‘1’. This means that the string will have only one
character and this is the onlly case such happening. So, if the whole
string is constructed out of ‘1’, we print “Yes” only if the size of the
string is 4, since only <code>r = c = 2</code> is a good matrix for
us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can understand the solution so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Otherwise, we have at least one ‘0’ in the string. Let's look at what
is the index of the first ‘0’.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If it has index <code>r + 1</code>, since the whole first line and
first character of the first line equal to ‘1’, so now, we have a fixed
value of <code>r</code> (index of the first ‘0’ minus 1) and the answer
is “Yes” only if <code>r</code> is the square root of
<code>n</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see. Because it's guaranteed that the input string is already a
beautiful one, calculating <code>r</code> is enough to solve the
problem. Genius.</p>
<p>My solution of 2008A and 2008B are different from the optimal, but I
managed to pass the tests. It's interesting.</p>
<p>I remember that someone said the flexibility of the solutions is an
exciting point of competitive programming.</p>
