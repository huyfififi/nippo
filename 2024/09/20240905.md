I don\'t know why, but the today\'s meeting was exhausting.

## Peeking (?) Under the Hood of PyMuPDF

[pymupdf/PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF)

There are several options such as [jsvine/pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) when it comes to PDF management, and our team uses `PyMuPDF` for that purpose.

### Integer as a Flag

Redaction is removing visible texts or graphics from a PDF document. It\'s used to hide sensitive information or reduce the entropy of PDF pages.

To do redactions with PyMuPDF, we first need to use `Page.add_redact_annot()` to add redaction annotations, and they call `Page.apply_redactions()`.

```
# document: fitz.Document
# rectangles: list[tuple[int, int, int, int]]

page: fitz.Page = document[0]  # first page
for rect in rectangles:
  page.add_redact_annot(rect)
page.apply_redactions()
```

[Page.apply\_redactions](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/page.html#Page.apply_redactions)

What I stumbled upon today is the `text` option. The document says its default value is `text=PDF_REDACT_TEXT_REMOVE | 0` but the constant `PDF_REDACT_TEXT_REMOVE` does not exist in the code base. So, in the reality, I\'m expected to pass `int` to the argument.

It can be confirmed in the source code

```
def apply_redactions(
    page: pymupdf.Page, images: int = 2, graphics: int = 1, text: int = 0
) -> bool:
```

I may be totally wrong, but I prefer not using `int` as a kind of flag.

PyMongo has similar implementation.

[PyMongo: `collection` - Collection level operations](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pymongo/collection.html)

> pymongo.ASCENDING = 1

> > Ascending sort order.

> pymongo.DESCENDING = -1

> > Descending sort order.

I remember that once I asked my colleague to use the constants `pymongo.ASCENDING` and `pymongo.DESCENDING` instead of integers `1` and `-1` because when seeing `1` and `-1` in the source code, it\'s not obvious what they mean. Whereas, the constants convey good amount of information.

If I were to implement a similar method, I would define constants in the same way as PyMongo because integers hardly have information/readability.

But I\'m not sure. There may be some advantages of simply using integers. Please correct me if my understanding is stupid.

### Binary Expressions as Flags

[PyMuPDF/src\_classic/helper-python.i](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF/blob/b68f183cddaa6ac7b715e1f68fa923cd680711e3/src_classic/helper-python.i)

```python
TEXT_PRESERVE_LIGATURES = 1
TEXT_PRESERVE_WHITESPACE = 2
TEXT_PRESERVE_IMAGES = 4
TEXT_INHIBIT_SPACES = 8
TEXT_DEHYPHENATE = 16
TEXT_PRESERVE_SPANS = 32
TEXT_MEDIABOX_CLIP = 64
TEXT_CID_FOR_UNKNOWN_UNICODE = 128

TEXTFLAGS_BLOCKS = (0
        | TEXT_PRESERVE_LIGATURES
        | TEXT_PRESERVE_WHITESPACE
        | TEXT_MEDIABOX_CLIP
        | TEXT_CID_FOR_UNKNOWN_UNICODE
        )
```

[PyMuPDF/src\_classic/utils.py](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF/blob/b68f183cddaa6ac7b715e1f68fa923cd680711e3/src_classic/utils.py#L789)

```python
def get_text(
    page: Page,
    option: str = "text",
    clip: rect_like = None,
    flags: OptInt = None,
    textpage: TextPage = None,
    sort: bool = False,
    delimiters=None,
):
    formats = {
        "text": fitz.TEXTFLAGS_TEXT,
        "html": fitz.TEXTFLAGS_HTML,
        "json": fitz.TEXTFLAGS_DICT,
        "rawjson": fitz.TEXTFLAGS_RAWDICT,
        "xml": fitz.TEXTFLAGS_XML,
        "xhtml": fitz.TEXTFLAGS_XHTML,
        "dict": fitz.TEXTFLAGS_DICT,
        "rawdict": fitz.TEXTFLAGS_RAWDICT,
        "words": fitz.TEXTFLAGS_WORDS,
        "blocks": fitz.TEXTFLAGS_BLOCKS,
    }

    # ...

    if option == "blocks":
        return get_text_blocks(
            page, clip=clip, flags=flags, textpage=textpage, sort=sort
        )
```

My brain cells are dying due to fatigue, but I would like to note that the flags are managed with the power of 2.

For example, `3 = b11` means `TEXT_PRESERVE_LIGATURES (= 1)` and `TEXT_PRESERVE_WHITESPACE (= 2)` are turned on.

It is embarassing, but I have never seen this implementation before. I find it a great way of managing multiple flags; it\'s just easy to understand and manage.

I hope I get a chance to do this someday, in some projects.

10k run

I watched a YouTube video saying that 60\~70% of the max heart rate is best for jogging.

My max heart rate is around 200, maybe, and I tried to keep my heart rate around 120\~140.

It turned out that my heart rate bumped to 150 and ended up at 170, even though I tried to run at the slowest speed possible.

How is it possible to keep a heart rate below 60% of max? Interesting.
