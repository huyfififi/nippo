of Concerns) in Software Design</h2>

of Concerns in Software Design | Alexey Naumov</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is so crucial that 2 out of 5 SOLID principles (Single
Responsibility and Interface Segregation) are direct derivations from
this concept.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The principle is simple: don’t write your program as one solid block,
instead, break up the code into chunks that are finalized tiny pieces of
the system each able to complete a simple distinct job.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we take the lowest level (the actual programming code), SoC
instructs us to avoid writing long complex functions. When the function
starts to bloat up in size, this is the red flag that the method is
possibly taking care of too many things at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Code That Fits in Your Head” mentions the similar thing. Basically,
the blog suggests that the number of things going on in one function
should be less than or equals to 7.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The application of the Separation of Concerns involve two processes:
reduction of coupling and increasing cohesion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cohesion is the measure of similarity by the set of duties, level of
details, and locality. For example, functions <code>drawCircle</code>
and <code>drawTriangle</code> are cohesive enough to belong to the same
module responsible for drawing, and it <em>feels</em> natural to put
these two functions close to each other in the code (high similarity ~
high cohesion).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we need to jump around between the functions or modules as we're
following the logic of the algorithm, this means the code has low
cohesion, which is often referred to as a Spaghetti code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Loose Coupling and High Cohesion</strong> -&gt; I should
remember this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary goal of the system's design is to outline the boundaries
for the module's awareness of each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The example makes sense. Letting business logic directly access its
database even though there is a database gateway will result in
production issues.</p>
<p>There are soem concepts I don't know now. I'll come back after doing
some research.</p>

of concerns - Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In computer science, separation of concerns (sometimes abbreviated as
SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into
distinct sections. Each section addresses a separate concern, a set of
information that affects the code of a computer program.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Separation of concerns results in more degrees of freedom for some
aspect of the program's design, deployment, or usage. Common among these
is increased freedom for simplification and maintenance of code. When
concerns are well-separated, there are more opportunities for module
upgrade, reuse, and independent development. Hiding the implementation
details of modules behind an interface enables improving or modifying a
single concern's section of code without having to know the details of
other sections and without having to make corresponding changes to those
other sections. Modules can also expose different versions of an
interface, which increases the freedom to upgrade a complex system in
piecemeal fashion without interim loss of functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had a mob programming session yesterday and guided on how separate
applications in Django projects offers advantages, such as better
reusability, portability, or maintainability.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the design to have multiple Django applications in one
project is related to SoC.</p>
