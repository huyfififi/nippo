<ul>
<li>Finished reading chapter ~9 of “Code That Fits in Your Head”
<ul>
<li>I understand the notion of “Command Query Separation,” returning the
result of side effects is helpful and I don't find any db packages that
enforce it. For example, <code>pymongo</code> returns the result of db
operations such as inserts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Checked Codeforces API to see if there are some problem rating
information I can use
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://codeforces.com/apiHelp/objects#Problem">Problem.rating</a>
can be used.</li>
<li>Added some metrics about problem ratings in dashboard-backend API
(not deployed yet)</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="mime-types">MIME types</h2>
<p><a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types">MDN
| MIME types (IANA media types) - HTTP</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
or MIME type) indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or
assortment of bytes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: Browsers use the MIME type, not the file extension, to
determine how to process a URL, so it’s important that web servers send
the correct MIME type in the response's <code>Content-Type</code>
header. If this is not correctly configured, browsers are likely to
misinterpret the contents of files, sites will not work correctly, and
downloaded files may be mishandled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the exact mistake I made today. CSS files are passed as
<code>text/html</code>, failing to make browsers understand it.</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-a-mime-type">Structure of a MIME type</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A MIME type most commonly consists of just two parts: a <em>type</em>
and a <em>subtype</em>, separated by a slash (<code>/</code>) — with no
whitespace between:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>type/subtype</code></pre>
<p>Examples: <code>text/plain</code>, <code>text/css</code>,
<code>text/html</code>, <code>application/json</code></p>

<h2 id="ingress">Ingress</h2>
<p><a
href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/">Ingress
| Kubernetes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to
services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules
defined on the Ingress resource.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ingress-controllers">Ingress Controllers</h3>
<p><a
href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/">Ingress
Controllers | Kubernetes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an
ingress controller running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ingress Controllers seem to be softwares required to make Ingress
work. There are various ingress controller implementation as the web
page lists.</p>
<p>For example, when using AWS EKS, AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
will be used.</p>
<h3 id="an-ingress-controller-as-a-reverse-proxy">An ingress controller
as a reverse proxy</h3>
<p>The official document says nothing about the similarity with a
reverse proxy, but I believe they are the same at a high level;</p>
<p>An ingress controller routes traffic from the outside of the cluter
to services within the cluster whereas a reverse proxy routes traffic to
(internal) servers.</p>
