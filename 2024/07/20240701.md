I didn\'t plan to work hard today, but did somehow.

- Updated my resume with the experience with CI pipelines

## [1986C. Update Queries](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1986/C)

It\'s been a while since I solved this in the contest, and it took me some time to remember how I approached this.

If there are multiple indices with the same value, we can use the corresponding lexicographically smallest character from c. The others will be discarded.

s = "abc"

ind = [0, 0, 0]

c = "def" -(rearrange)-> "fed"

result = "dbc" ( < "ebc" or "fbc")

- sort `ind` to group the same values
- sort `c` to update `s` with the lexicographically smallest values. 

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s: list[str] = list(input())
    ind: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ind.sort()
    c = input()
    c: list[str] = sorted(c)

    prev_ind = None
    ci = 0
    for i in range(m):
        if ind[i] != prev_ind:
            s[ind[i] - 1] = c[ci]
            ci += 1
        prev_ind = ind[i]
    print("".join(s))
```

## [1945B. Fireworks](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1945/B)

1 <= a, b, m <= 10 ** 18 -> need to solve in O(1)

To maximize the number of fireworks -> fires both of the fireworks at the same time (at `a` * `b` minutes for any `a` and `b`).

When firing both fireworks, the number of fireworks that can be seen at `m` is `m // a + 1` (including the starting point). Same goes for `b`

result: (m // a + 1) + (m // b + 1)

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    # num of 1st fireworks that can exist at the same time
    first: int = m // a + 1
    # num of 2nd fireworks that can exist at the same time
    second: int = m // b + 1
    res: int = first + second
    print(res)
```
