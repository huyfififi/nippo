## [1918A. Brick Wall](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1918/A)

maximize the number of horizontal bricks <=> use as many 1\*2 (smallest) bricks as possible

m is even => (horizontal, vertical) = (n * m // 2, 0)

m is odd => (horizontal, vertical) = (n * (m - 1) // 2, 0), for the last 3 columns, we use 1\*3 bricks so that we don\'t need to use vertical bricks.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m % 2 == 0:
        print(n * m // 2)
    else:
        print(n * (m - 1) // 2)
```
