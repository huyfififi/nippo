## [1918A. Brick Wall](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1918/A)

maximize the number of horizontal bricks <=> use as many 1\*2 (smallest) bricks as possible

m is even => (horizontal, vertical) = (n * m // 2, 0)

m is odd => (horizontal, vertical) = (n * (m - 1) // 2, 0), for the last 3 columns, we use 1\*3 bricks so that we don\'t need to use vertical bricks.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m % 2 == 0:
        print(n * m // 2)
    else:
        print(n * (m - 1) // 2)
```

## [1917A. Least Product](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1917/A)

```
def solve(n: int, a: list[int]) -> tuple[int, list[tuple[int, int]]]:
    if 0 in a:
        return 0, []

    if sum(1 for x in a if x < 0) % 2 == 0:
        return 1, [(1, 0)]

    return 0, []


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k, ops = solve(n, a)
    print(k)
    for i in range(k):
        print(f"{ops[i][0]} {ops[i][1]}")
```

## [1922A. Tricky Template](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1922/A)

> Accordingly, the string doesn\'t match the template if the condition doesn\'t hold for at least one *i*.

To make the string *c* does not match the template, we only need one position that does not meet the criteria.

When c[i] equals to a[i] or b[i], we cannot create a template that a[i] and b[i] match and c[i] does not.

a[i] = "a", b[i] = "b", c[i] = "c" => t[i] = "C"

a[i] = "a", b[i] = "b", c[i] = "a" => cannot make a[i] meet the criteria and c[i] does not as they are the same.

```
def exists(n: int, a: str, b: str, c: str) -> bool:
    for i in range(n):
        if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]:
            return True
    return False


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()

    if exists(n, a, b, c):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

Since tracking calories intake did not work this time and I\'m getting overweight, let\'s try low carbohydrate diet for a few months.

MCT oil is not sold at the nearest Safeway. I might want to check Target tomorrow.

Eggs 20g
salad 20g
Sashimi 5g
Meat stick 0g

Total carbohydrate 45g (< 60g)
