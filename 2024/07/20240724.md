## [1995A. Diagonals](https://codeforces.com/contest/1995/problem/A)

It took me some time to realize that *diagonals* in this problem does not include ones from top-left to bottom-right.

> A diagonal is the set of cells for which the value `i + j` is the same.

To minimize the number of occupied diagonals, we should place chips from the longest diagonals to the shortest.

first diagonal => `i + j = n` => `n` chips

second/third diagonals => `i + j = n - 1` => `2 * (n - 1)` chips

`2 * (n - 2)`, `2 * (n - 3)`, ...

```
def solve(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    if k <= n:
        return 1

    count = 1
    k -= n
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        count += 1
        k -= i
        if k <= 0:
            return count
        count += 1
        k -= i
        if k <= 0:
            return count
    return count


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(solve(n, k))
```
