# 20240728

taking a break

During these days off, I achieved

- Finished reading "Code That Fits in Your Head"
	- and created a note and a repository for our study group.
- Created command-line tool, which is written in Rust, to count cyclomatic complexity of Python code.
	- and created a GitHub Actions workflow in my repository to check the complexity of functions are no more than 7.
- Reviewed many Codeforces problems and participated in one contest.

I think I did very well. Didn\'t I?

I want to go to the office tomorrow, but I\'m not confident I can do it since my circadian rhythm is broken.
