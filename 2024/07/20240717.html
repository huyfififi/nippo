<h2 id="gc---garbage-collector-interface-python">gc - Garbage Collector
Interface (Python)</h2>
<p>Python already has garbage collectors. For example, CPython counts
the number of references to a specific memory field, and once the memory
is not referenced anymore, the memory will be freed.</p>
<p>If my understanding is correct, I have no idea when and how to use
<code>gc</code> module. I can see that my colleagues use it to reduce
the memory usage, but I need to check if it's right.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html">gc - Garbage
Collector Interface - Python 3.12.4 Documentation</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This module provides an interface to the optional garbage collector.
It provides the ability to disable the collector, tune the collection
frequency, and set debugging options. It also provides access to
unreachable objects that the collector found but cannot free. Since the
collector supplements the reference counting already used in Python, you
can disable the collector if you are sure your program does not create
reference cycles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3
id="gc.collectgeneration2"><code>gc.collect(generation=2)</code></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With no arguments, run a full collection. The effect of calling
gc.collect() while the interpreter is already performing a collection is
undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, calling <code>gc.collect()</code> is dangerous because
CPython's garbage collection is already running, and they would
conflict.</p>
<p>However, I found this thread.</p>

href="https://groups.google.com/g/celery-users/c/jVc3I3kPtlw">Celery
doesn't release memory after finishing a task</a></p>
<p>It's an old thread, but our application seems to face the same issue,
running <code>gc.collect()</code> at the end of a task frees huge amount
of memory.</p>
<p>So, in our case, calling <code>gc.collect()</code> to free memory
used in Celery makes sense.</p>
