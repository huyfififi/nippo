<p>It's annoying to be disputed without clear evidence or understanding
of the topic.</p>
<p>I also feel jittery when software engineers with a couple of years of
experience don't understand how <code>git</code> works and can't touch
commit histories, lacking the knowledge of <code>git rebase</code> or
other common commands. - but it's also true that I lack common knowledge
of software engineering in some parts, and great people think I'm a
random moron. - For example, it seems most successful software engineers
(especially in Japan) are very good at competitive programming, which
I'm trying to catch up with.</p>
<p>It was fun contributing to my friend's GitHub repository, but I'm
withdrawing. I better charge if I continue to provide insights or guide
tasks.</p>

<h2 id="wheel-the-binary-distribution-format-for-python-packages">Wheel,
the binary distribution format for Python packages</h2>
<p><a
href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/">Binary
distribution format</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A wheel is a ZIP-format archive with a specially formatted file name
and the <code>.whl</code> extension. It contains a single distribution
nearly as it would be installed according to PEP 376 with a particular
installation scheme. Although a specialized installer is recommended, a
wheel file may be installed by simply unpacking into site-packages with
the standard ‘unzip’ tool while preserving enough information to spread
its contents out onto their final paths at any later time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wheel is a format for binary distrubition, and using it is highly
recommended to distribute, for example, publish a package to PyPI.</p>

binary distribution to PyPI using PDM</h3>
<p><a href="https://pdm-project.org/latest/usage/publish/">Build and
Publish</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are developing a library, after adding dependencies to your
project, and finishing the coding, it’s time to build and publish your
package. It is as simple as one command:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><code>pdm publish</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This will automatically build a wheel and a source
distribution(sdist), and upload them to the PyPI index.</p>
