# 20240706

- Read three sections of "Just for Fun"
	- The second chapter is much longer than expected. Reading one chapter a day is an unrealistic goal.
	- I read "Unix: A History and a Memoir" a long time ago, and it helps me enjoy the book about Linux now.
	- It\'s interesting that several books suggest the free software movement (?) is derived from the (sort of) hippie culture which was trending at that time. Of course, I was not born yet at that time.
	- Even Linus was not there when Unix appeared.
- Merged pull requests created by Dependabot in `dashboard-backend`
- Solved 2 Codeforces problems
- Reviewed 2 Codeforces problems I have solved

If I had been born into a rich and supportive family, and with a higher IQ, I would have pursued a Ph.D. in OS research.

Reviewed problems

## [1956A. Nene\'s Game](https://codeforces.com/contest/1956/problem/A)

brute force can solve the problem O(n^3) (?)

```
while there are players to kick out:  # ~= O(n)
  new_players = []
  for player in players:  # ~= O(n)
    if player not in ITH_TO_KICK_OUT:  # ~= O(n)
      new_players.append(player)
```

The search part can be improved to O(logn) by leveraging a binary search

O(n^2logn)?

```
if player not in a:
->
if binary_search(player) == -1:
```

[Editorial: Codeforces Roudn 939 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/128426)

It\'s embarassing that I did not notice this last time I tackled the problem.

Let\'s say we have 10 players [1, 2, ..., 10] and a (indices to kick out) = [3, 5]

The players [1, 2] always stays after any number of operations to remove 3th and 5th players. Conversely, [3, 4, ...] players will be kicked out in the end by repeating kicking out the 3th player.

Therefore, the answer to the question, i.e., the number of players left in the end is `a[0] - 1 if n >= a[0] else n`

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for ni in n:
        res.append(min(a[0] - 1, ni))
    print(" ".join(str(x) for x in res))
```

## [1934A. Too Min Too Max](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1934/A)

Let\'s consider with only 4 numbers where a <= b <= c <= d

When thinking about possible expressions(orderings), they are

- `|a - b| + |b - c| + |c - d| + |d - a|`, (`|a - b| + |b - d| + |d - c| + |c - a|`)
	- `(b - a) + (c - b) + (d - c) + (d - a) = 2d - 2a`
- `|a - c| + |c - b| + |b - d| + |d - a|`
	- `(c - a) + (c - b) + (d - b) + (d - a) = 2d + 2c - 2b - 2a > 2d - 2a because 2c > 2b`

Therefore, the answer is 2(c + d) - 2(a + b), picking the two largest numbers as c and d, and the smallest numbers as a and b

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    # a <= b <= c <= d
    a, b, c, d = a[0], a[1], a[-2], a[-1]
    print(2 * (c + d) - 2 * (a + b))
```

## [1915C. Can I Square?](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1915/C)

I know how the binary search works, but I always feel unconfident about corner cases and base conditions(?).

It\'s fairly easy to write a binary search when asked, but the problem is that I cannot realize the use of a binary search during the contest. 

By the way, this is the exact problem I was asked in my first coding interview with [Fixstars](https://www.fixstars.com/ja). You can already tell that I didn\'t pass the interview.

```
def can_square(n: int) -> bool:
    l = 1  # This was important I set l = 0 and return a wrong answer when n = 1 and a = 1
    r = n
    while l < r - 1:
        m = (l + r) // 2
        if m * m > n:
            r = m
        else:
            l = m
    if l * l == n:
        return True
    return False


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    num_squares = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_square(num_squares):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

## [1978B. New Bakery](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1978/B)

```
def profit(n: int, k: int, a: int, b: int) -> int:
    discounted: int = (b + 1) * k - (1 + k) * k // 2  # sum(1..k), k or k + 1 % 2 == 1
    usual: int = (n - k) * a
    return discounted + usual


def return_k(n: int, a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if b < a:
        return 0
    k = b - a + 1  # max
    if k > n:
        return n
    return k


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    k = return_k(n, a, b)
    print(profit(n, k, a, b))
```

I missed to record my exercises last few weeks but that should be fine. The primary reason of this report is to push me to study programming.
