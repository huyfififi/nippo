# 20240706

- Read three sections of "Just for Fun"
	- The second chapter is much longer than expected. Reading one chapter a day is an unrealistic goal.
- Merged pull requests created by Dependabot in `dashboard-backend`
- Solved 2 Codeforces problems

## [1915C. Can I Square?](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1915/C)

I know how the binary search works, but I always feel unconfident about corner cases and base conditions(?).

It\'s fairly easy to write a binary search when asked, but the problem is that I cannot realize the use of a binary search during the contest. 

By the way, this is the exact problem I was asked in my first coding interview with [Fixstars](https://www.fixstars.com/ja). You can already tell that I didn\'t pass the interview.

```
def can_square(n: int) -> bool:
    l = 1  # This was important I set l = 0 and return a wrong answer when n = 1 and a = 1
    r = n
    while l < r - 1:
        m = (l + r) // 2
        if m * m > n:
            r = m
        else:
            l = m
    if l * l == n:
        return True
    return False


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    num_squares = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_square(num_squares):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

## [1978B. New Bakery](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1978/B)

```
def profit(n: int, k: int, a: int, b: int) -> int:
    discounted: int = (b + 1) * k - (1 + k) * k // 2  # sum(1..k), k or k + 1 % 2 == 1
    usual: int = (n - k) * a
    return discounted + usual


def return_k(n: int, a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if b < a:
        return 0
    k = b - a + 1  # max
    if k > n:
        return n
    return k


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    k = return_k(n, a, b)
    print(profit(n, k, a, b))
```
