- Read three sections of "Just for Fun"
	- The second chapter is much longer than expected. Reading one chapter a day is an unrealistic goal.
- Merged pull requests created by Dependabot in `dashboard-backend`

## [Can I Square?](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1915/C)

I know how the binary search works, but I always feel unconfident about corner cases and base conditions(?).

It\'s fairly easy to write a binary search when asked, but the problem is that I cannot realize the use of a binary search during the contest. 

By the way, this is the exact problem I was asked in my first coding interview with [Fixstars](https://www.fixstars.com/ja). You can already tell that I didn\'t pass the interview.

```
def can_square(n: int) -> bool:
    l = 1  # This was important I set l = 0 and return a wrong answer when n = 1 and a = 1
    r = n
    while l < r - 1:
        m = (l + r) // 2
        if m * m > n:
            r = m
        else:
            l = m
    if l * l == n:
        return True
    return False


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    num_squares = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_square(num_squares):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```
