## [1983A. Array Divisibility](https://codeforces.com/contest/1983/problem/A)

It felt good to have this problem solved.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(" ".join([str(x) for x in range(1, n + 1)]))
```

**My Thought Process**

The easiest way to make the sum of numbers, whose indices are multiple of `k`, divisible by `k`, we can pick multiples of `k` for the numbers.

For example, when thinking about `k = 3` and 10 input numbers, we need to pick `{3a, 3b, 3c} where a, b, and c are integers` for indices `3, 6, and 9`, so that, the sum will be `3(a + b + c)` which is divisible by 3.

I first thought of multiplying corresponding indices by 1, 2, 3, ..., n, but after consideration, found out the array [1, 2, ..., n] meets the condition!
