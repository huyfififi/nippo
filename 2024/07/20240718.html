Meta-Scientific Perspective on “Thinking: Fast and Slow”</a>

<li>I don't understand everything on the article, their claims make
sense; the book's references are quite shaky, and it might be better to
consider it as a subjective matter of the eminent psychologist, Daniel
Kahneman.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Rye is a comprehensive project and package management solution for
Python. Rye picks and ships the right tools so you can get started in
minutes:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>astral-sh/ruff</code> as a formatter.</li>
<li><code>astral-sh/uv</code> with <code>unearth</code> and
<code>pip-tools</code> as a package manager</li>
</ul>
<p>Resolving dependencies and installing packages never be bottlenecks,
and it's more important to make it easy to set up CI pipelines.</p>
<p>From that standpoint, <code>dependabot</code> seems to lack its
native support, whereas <code>poetry</code> which has the most stars on
GitHub is natively supported and D<code>dependabot</code> can create
pull requests automatically.</p>
<p>About GitHub Actions, <code>rye</code> generates
<code>requirements.lock</code> which can be used as a normal
<code>requirements.txt</code> in <code>pip</code>, so it was not
difficult to have GitHub Actions workflows.</p>
<p>Its performance is quite impressive, but at the moment I'm writing
this entry, <code>poetry</code> is the go-to option for me. It has the
largest community, and when having issues, I can easily find solutions
on the internet.</p>
