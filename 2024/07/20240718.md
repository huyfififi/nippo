- Ordered keto supplement and other daily neccessities
- Read [A Meta-Scientific Perspective on "Thinking: Fast and Slow"](https://replicationindex.com/2020/12/30/a-meta-scientific-perspective-on-thinking-fast-and-slow/)
	- I don\'t understand everything on the article, their claims make sense; the book\'s references are quite shaky, and it might be better to consider it as a subjective matter of the eminent psychologist, Daniel Kahneman.
- Turned on `dependabot` for `huyfififi/dashboard-backend`

## `Rye`

[astral-sh/rye](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye)

> Rye is a comprehensive project and package management solution for Python.
> Rye picks and ships the right tools so you can get started in minutes:

- `astral-sh/ruff` as a formatter.
- `astral-sh/uv` with `unearth` and `pip-tools` as a package manager

Resolving dependencies and installing packages never be bottlenecks, and it\'s more important to make it easy to set up CI pipelines.

From that standpoint, `dependabot` seems to lack its native support, whereas `poetry` which has the most stars on GitHub is natively supported and D`dependabot` can create pull requests automatically.

About GitHub Actions, `rye` generates `requirements.lock` which can be used as a normal `requirements.txt` in `pip`, so it was not difficult to have GitHub Actions workflows.

Its performance is quite impressive, but at the moment I\'m writing this entry, `poetry` is the go-to option for me. It has the largest community, and when having issues, I can easily find solutions on the internet.

## `dependabot`

[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file)

This page guides me on how to configure `dependabot` of GitHub. Only issue I faced is

> Tip: For package managers such as pipenv and poetry, you need to use the pip YAML value.
> For example, if you use poetry to manage your Python dependencies and want Dependabot to monitor your dependency manifest file for new versions, use package-ecosystem: "pip" in your dependabot.yml file.

So, I need to set `package-ecosystem: "pip"` instead of `"poetry"`.

Not sure my configuration will work correctly. The format check has passed, but I will keep seeing the repository and its behavior.

```
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    reviewers:
      - "huyfififi"
    versioning-strategy: "increase"
```
