- Ordered keto supplement and other daily neccessities
- Read [A Meta-Scientific Perspective on "Thinking: Fast and Slow"](https://replicationindex.com/2020/12/30/a-meta-scientific-perspective-on-thinking-fast-and-slow/)
	- I don\'t understand everything on the article, their claims make sense; the book\'s references are quite shaky, and it might be better to consider it as a subjective matter of the eminent psychologist, Daniel Kahneman.

## `Rye`

[astral-sh/rye](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye)

> Rye is a comprehensive project and package management solution for Python.
> Rye picks and ships the right tools so you can get started in minutes:

- `astral-sh/ruff` as a formatter.
- `astral-sh/uv` with `unearth` and `pip-tools` as a package manager

Resolving dependencies and installing packages never be bottlenecks, and it\'s more important to make it easy to set up CI pipelines.

From that standpoint, `dependabot` seems to lack its native support, whereas `poetry` which has the most stars on GitHub is natively supported and D`dependabot` can create pull requests automatically.

About GitHub Actions, `rye` generates `requirements.lock` which can be used as a normal `requirements.txt` in `pip`, so it was not difficult to have GitHub Actions workflows.

Its performance is quite impressive, but at the moment I\'m writing this entry, `poetry` is the go-to option for me. It has the largest community, and when having issues, I can easily find solutions on the internet.
