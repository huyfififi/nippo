- Participated Codeforces Round 957 (Div. 3)
	- I\'m frustrated that I could not solve the fourth problem, which I seem to do dynamic programming.
- Almost finished reading "Just for Fun"
	- It\'s quite interesting that Linus is not interested in money (or fame) much. If I were in his position, I would think about making more money than he has (I suffered from sort of poverty when I was a child. I hope that makes enough justification).
		- But then, he worried about stock options. His stance looks (sort of) contradictory(, but all humans are inherently inconsistent.)
	- Linus mentions a few places I know in San Francisco Bay Area. Fuku Sushi in Palo Alto, San Jose Convention Centor, etc, making me feel familiar with him.
	- Wow, It\'s been over 20 years since the book has been published.

It was a long day...
