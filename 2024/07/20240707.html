<ul>
<li>Participated in Codeforces Round 956 (Div. 2)
<ul>
<li>I'm happy that I came up with the optimal answer for the first
problem, but the second problem was too hard for me, reducing my
rating.</li>
<li>I better keep going without worrying about the rating for now. I'm
just a beginner, and it's not that important.</li>
<li>I stayed all night to participate in the contest, and now I feel
tired. Let's take a shower and go to bed to read books.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Finished an artwork</li>
<li>Several calls and set up an international payment. Well done.</li>
