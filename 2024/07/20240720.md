- Read the chapter 13 of "Code That Fits in Your Head"
- Created a summary of the chatper 13
	- Logging is important, and it can be implemented with *Decorator* pattern (from GoF).
	- Tried to write a simple example with the Python decorator

```
logs = []


def log_decorator(method):
    @functools.wraps(method)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = method(*args, **kwargs)
        logs.append(
            {
                "timestamp": time.time(),
                "result": result,
            }
        )
        return result
    return wrapper
```

In the real world, I better use `logging` or `structlog`, but it\'s worth remembering I can use the decorator for some use cases.
