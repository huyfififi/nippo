<ul>
<li>Contributed a lot to my friend's repository.
<ul>
<li>Tried code forking instead of feature branching.
<ul>
<li>This is the first time I used the fork model on GitHub. I think the
fork model is more common in the OSS world, and I'm glad to have
experience on that.</li>
<li>can avoid corrupting the upstream repository with a bunch of
branches.</li>
<li>Found a good summary of Forking v.s. Branching <a

<li>I did it on BitBucket a while ago, but I lost the memory.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explored PDM <a
href="https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm">pdm-project/pdm</a>
<ul>
<li>The latest (?) Python package and dependency manager, which clamins
to be superior to <code>Pipenv</code>, <code>Poetry</code>, or
<code>Hatch</code>.</li>
<li>Its usage is fairly simple and similar to <code>poetry</code>. I
could easily catch up with it.</li>
<li>However, I found it difficult to configure PDM in Docker properly.
When virtual environments get involved in Docker, it's super difficult
and don't find any useful resources to resolve the issues I have.</li>
<li>Just exporting <code>requirements.txt</code> for now. It's much
easier to configure.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read the chapter 3 and 4 of “Code That Fits In Your Head”
<ul>
<li>The sample code is written in C# (which is only popular in the game
industry), it's kind of hard to digest the sample code.</li>
<li>I think most good engineers are already aware of the technique in
the book.</li>
<li>Because code is read more than it's written, code should be
optimized for readability instead of technical details such as
programming languages or frameworks.
<ul>
<li>The author suggests using <code>7</code> as the number of things a
human can remember at one time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To make a software sustainable, it's important to focus on its value
but not too focus on it at the same time. Sustainability comes with the
perspectives of the both sides.</li>
</ul></li>
