<h2 id="can-i-square"><a
href="https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1915/C">Can I
Square?</a></h2>
<p>I know how the binary search works, but I always feel unconfident
about corner cases and base conditions(?).</p>
<p>It's fairly easy to write a binary search when asked, but the problem
is that I cannot realize the use of a binary search during the
contest.</p>
<p>By the way, this is the exact problem I was asked in my first coding
interview with <a href="https://www.fixstars.com/ja">Fixstars</a>. You
can already tell that I didn't pass the interview.</p>
<pre><code>def can_square(n: int) -&gt; bool:
    l = 1  # This was important I set l = 0 and return a wrong answer when n = 1 and a = 1
    r = n
    while l &lt; r - 1:
        m = (l + r) // 2
        if m * m &gt; n:
            r = m
        else:
            l = m
    if l * l == n:
        return True
    return False


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    num_squares = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_square(num_squares):
        print(&quot;YES&quot;)
    else:
        print(&quot;NO&quot;)</code></pre>
