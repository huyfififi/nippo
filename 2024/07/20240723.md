# 20240723

- I\'ve been writing Rust problems, and it\'s driving me insane.
	- Released v0.0.1 of the command to count cyclomatic complexity [huyfififi/cyclon](https://github.com/huyfififi/cyclon)
	- Configured a GitHub Actions workflow with the project. ex. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/huyfififi/dashboard-backend/actions/runs/10072609277/job/27844890047)
	- I created the base structure of the project. I\'ll create pull requests from now on. Not sure my friend is willing to review them tho.
- Participated Codeforces Round 961 (Div. 2)
	- Let\'s play Gym instead of maximizing the number of participated contests.

## [1988A. Split the Multiset](https://codeforces.com/contest/1988/problem/A)

The maximum number of ones I can increase in one operation => `k - 1`

How can I do that? => remove `n` and add (`k - 1` ones and `n - (k - 1)`)

For example, (n, k) = (16, 4)

```
{16}: initial state
{1, 1, 1, 13}
{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10}
{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7}
{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4}
{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
```

My takeaway is that I should think about the optimal number and consider how to do it after the observation.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    count: int = 0
    while n > 1:
        n -= k - 1
        count += 1
    print(count)
```
