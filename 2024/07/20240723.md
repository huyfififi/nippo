# 20240723

- I\'ve been writing Rust problems, and it\'s driving me insane.
	- Released v0.0.1 of the command to count cyclomatic complexity [huyfififi/cyclon](https://github.com/huyfififi/cyclon)
	- Configured a GitHub Actions workflow with the project. ex. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/huyfififi/dashboard-backend/actions/runs/10072609277/job/27844890047)
	- I created the base structure of the project. I\'ll create pull requests from now on. Not sure my friend is willing to review them tho.
- Participated Codeforces Round 961 (Div. 2)
	- Let\'s play Gym instead of maximizing the number of participated contests.
