<p>I feel a bit tired, mainly because I researched how to optimize
resources in machine-learning model inference very hard. Let's relax on
the weekend.</p>

<h2 id="a.-only-pluses"><a

Pluses</a></h2>
<p>Let's consider a simpler situation in which I get to incrase one of
the three numbers by 1.</p>
<p><code>a &lt;= b &lt;= c</code></p>
<p>I have three options</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(a + 1) * b * c</code> = <code>abc + bc</code></li>
<li><code>a * (b + 1) * c</code> = <code>abc + ac</code></li>
<li><code>a * b * (c + 1)</code> = <code>abc + ab</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Because a &lt;= b &lt;= c, bc &gt;= ac &gt;= ab. Therefore,
<code>(a + 1) * b * c</code> is the largest option, i.e., increaseing
the smallest number of three maximizing their product.</p>
<p>Is it guaranteed that maximizing the product for each step leads to
the maximum value in the end after applying the operation 5 times? I
don't know…</p>
<hr />
<p><code>torch.no_grad()</code> to disable gradient calculation and save
memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disabling gradient calculation is useful for inference, when you are
sure that you will not call Tensor.backward(). It will reduce memory
consumption for computations that would otherwise have
requires_grad=True.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried with our project, and (only) see a slight improvement on the
memory usage. Or, it's totally possible that I misunderstood something
and applied it in the wrong way (I don't see many web pages on the
function usage).</p>
<p>Also, I was browing the web pages of TorchScript, but couldn't figure
it out.</p>
