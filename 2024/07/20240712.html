<p>I feel a bit tired, mainly because I researched how to optimize
resources in machine-learning model inference very hard. Let's relax on
the weekend.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Finished reading “Just for Fun”
<ul>
<li>Linus says humans’ motivation factors are <code>survival</code>,
<code>social order</code>, and <code>entertainment</code> in this order,
as we no longer fight for <code>survival</code>, or
<code>social order</code> at some point, everything ends up to
<code>entertainment</code>, i.e., doing things just for fun.</li>
<li>The idea is not very new. Actually, it resembles to Maslow’s
hierarchy of needs. However, his philosophy well represents the entire
Linux histroy/ecosystem.</li>
<li>The latter half of the book was not quite interesting, but it was
interesting to learn his humorous attitude and his personality changes
on the course. The history of the early Linux was also an enjoyable
material.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Met some new people
<ul>
<li>They were nice. Hope this relationship continues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Browsed my friend's GitHub repository, submitted 6 issues, and
created 1 pull request. Wow, it's nice of me.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a.-only-pluses"><a

Pluses</a></h2>
<p>Let's consider a simpler situation in which I get to incrase one of
the three numbers by 1.</p>
<p><code>a &lt;= b &lt;= c</code></p>
<p>I have three options</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(a + 1) * b * c</code> = <code>abc + bc</code></li>
<li><code>a * (b + 1) * c</code> = <code>abc + ac</code></li>
<li><code>a * b * (c + 1)</code> = <code>abc + ab</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Because a &lt;= b &lt;= c, bc &gt;= ac &gt;= ab. Therefore,
<code>(a + 1) * b * c</code> is the largest option, i.e., increaseing
the smallest number of three maximizing their product.</p>
<p>Is it guaranteed that maximizing the product for each step leads to
the maximum value in the end after applying the operation 5 times? I
don't know…</p>
<hr />
<p><code>torch.no_grad()</code> to disable gradient calculation and save
memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disabling gradient calculation is useful for inference, when you are
sure that you will not call Tensor.backward(). It will reduce memory
consumption for computations that would otherwise have
requires_grad=True.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried with our project, and (only) see a slight improvement on the
memory usage. Or, it's totally possible that I misunderstood something
and applied it in the wrong way (I don't see many web pages on the
function usage).</p>
<p>Also, I was browing the web pages of TorchScript, but couldn't figure
it out.</p>
