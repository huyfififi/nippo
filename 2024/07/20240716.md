- Finished reading chapter \~9 of "Code That Fits in Your Head"
	- I understand the notion of "Command Query Separation," returning the result of side effects is helpful and I don\'t find any db packages that enforce it. For example, `pymongo` returns the result of db operations such as inserts.

## MIME types

[MDN | MIME types (IANA media types) - HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types)

> A media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type) indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes.

> Warning: Browsers use the MIME type, not the file extension, to determine how to process a URL, so it's important that web servers send the correct MIME type in the response\'s `Content-Type` header.
> If this is not correctly configured, browsers are likely to misinterpret the contents of files, sites will not work correctly, and downloaded files may be mishandled.

This is the exact mistake I made today. CSS files are passed as `text/html`, failing to make browsers understand it.

### Structure of a MIME type

> A MIME type most commonly consists of just two parts: a *type* and a *subtype*, separated by a slash (`/`) â€” with no whitespace between:

```
type/subtype
```

Examples: `text/plain`, `text/css`, `text/html`, `application/json`
