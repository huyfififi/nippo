- Participated in Codeforces Round 956 (Div. 2)
	- I\'m happy that I came up with the optimal answer for the first problem, but the second problem was too hard for me, reducing my rating.
	- I better keep going without worrying about the rating for now. I\'m just a beginner, and it\'s not that important.
	- I stayed all night to participate in the contest, and now I feel tired. Let\'s take a shower and go to bed to read books.
- Finished an artwork
- Several calls and set up an international payment. Well done.
