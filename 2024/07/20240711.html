<ul>
<li>Participated Codeforces Round 957 (Div. 3)
<ul>
<li>I'm frustrated that I could not solve the fourth problem, which I
seem to do dynamic programming.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Almost finished reading “Just for Fun”
<ul>
<li>It's quite interesting that Linus is not interested in money (or
fame) much. If I were in his position, I would think about making more
money than he has (I suffered from sort of poverty when I was a child. I
hope that makes enough justification).
<ul>
<li>But then, he worried about stock options. His stance looks (sort of)
contradictory(, but all humans are inherently inconsistent.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Linus mentions a few places I know in San Francisco Bay Area. Fuku
Sushi in Palo Alto, San Jose Convention Centor, etc, making me feel
familiar with him.</li>
<li>Wow, It's been over 20 years since the book has been published.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>It was a long day…</p>
