# 20240703

The ordered book "Just for Fun" about Linus Torvalds and the history of Linux just arrived. I peeked inside, and I was already hooked on it.
Tomorrow is a holiday. I may read the book and chill.

## [1916A. 2023](https://codeforces.com/contest/1916/problem/A)

```
def solve(rms: int, b: list[int]) -> tuple[bool, list[int]]:
    # 1. calculate the product of the removed numbers
    bproduct = 1
    for bi in b:
        bproduct *= bi

    if 2023 % bproduct != 0:
        return False, []

    removed = 2023 // bproduct

    # 2. factorization in prime numbers
    factors = []
    while removed > 1:
        for i in range(2, 2024):
            if removed % i == 0:
                factors.append(i)
                removed //= i

    # 3. append `1` to meet the number k
    # `1` does not change product of the removed numbers
    while len(factors) < rms:
        factors.append(1)

    # 4. combine factors when exceeding the number k
    while len(factors) > rms:
        if len(factors) == 1:
            return False, []
        # bug: factors = [factors[0] + factors[1]] + factors[2:]
        factors = [factors[0] * factors[1]] + factors[2:]

    return True, factors


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    exists, removed = solve(k, b)
    if exists:
        print("YES")
        print(" ".join([str(x) for x in removed]))
    else:
        print("NO")
```

low carbo diet does not suit to be extremely ripped, but in this phase, I think it is a good option.

Squid 0g 700kcal
Cheese 10g 300kcal
Protein shake 10g 200kcal
Salad 20g 400kcal
Monster 5g 0kcal
Octopus 0g 300kcal
meat stick 0g 100kcal

Total carbohydrate 45g (< 60g) 2000kcal
