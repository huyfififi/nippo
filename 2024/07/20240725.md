## [1985C. Good Prefixes](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1985/C)

`t <= 10 ^ 4` and `n <= 2 * 10 ^ 5`, so I needed to come up with a `O(n)` solution.

I thought of an approach that checks `sum // 2 in prefix` using `set` or `dict`, so that the check should be doen in `O(1)` and `O(n)` in total.

However, that approach exceeded the time limit on test 10. My suspicion is that, the number of elements I needed to hold in a hash table was too large, facing collisions, and the time complexity of the lookup became > `O(1)` (~=`O(n)`?), making the total time complexity exceed `O(n)`.

The fact I could not notice is that I only need to track the maximum number in a prefix because only the maximum number in a prefix can be `sum // 2`.
Other values cannot be satisfy the condition because the remaining part already contains a value bigger than the value, thus the value is always smaller than the sum, including the maximum element.

```
from collections import defaultdict


def solve(n: int, a: list[int]) -> int:
    su: int = 0
    ma: int = 0
    ans: int = 0
    for x in a:
        su += x
        ma = max(ma, x)
        if ma * 2 == su:
            ans += 1
    return ans


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    a: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans: int = solve(n, a)
    print(ans)
```
