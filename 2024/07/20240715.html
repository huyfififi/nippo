<blockquote>
<p>As Kent Beck puts it: The goal of software design is to create chunks
or slices that fit into a human mind. The software keeps growing but the
human mind maxes out, so we have to keep chunking and slicing
differently if we want to keeep making changes.</p>

<p>I think this is the primary message the book tells.</p>
<h2 id="async-and-await"><code>async</code> and <code>await</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/">FastAPI: Concurrency
and async / await</a></p>
<p>The detailed exmaples are a bit confusing for me… and it does not
provide clear definitions of the terminologies, not sure they have clear
definitions tho.</p>
<p>By leveraging asynchronous (concurrency) code, we can avoid blocking
I/O operations. Let's say, we have an API server that queries a database
and returns the result. When the server accept a request, the process
does not have to block I/O during database queries. Instead, the process
can wait for the result on the side, without blocking I/O, leveraging
concurrency.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">Python
Documentation: Coroutines and Tasks</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coroutines declared with the async/await syntax is the preferred way
of writing asyncio applications. For example, the following snippet of
code prints “hello”, waits 1 second, and then prints “world”:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import asyncio

&gt;&gt;&gt; async def main():
...     print(&#39;hello&#39;)
...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
...     print(&#39;world&#39;)

&gt;&gt;&gt; asyncio.run(main())
hello
world</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>coroutine Coroutines are a more generalized form of subroutines.
Subroutines are entered at one point and exited at another point.
Coroutines can be entered, exited, and resumed at many different points.
They can be implemented with the async def statement.</p>

Permutation</a></h2>
<p>I started with observation, using the third test case.</p>
<p><code>(n, m, k) = (10, 3, 8)</code></p>
<p>The sample test cases result in non-complete decreasing arrays. So, I
went ahead with <code>[10, 9, 8, ..., 3, 2, 1]</code></p>
<pre><code>f(1) = 10, g(1) = 0
f(2) = 19, g(2) = 0
f(3) = 27, g(3) = 0
f(4)~f(7) = 27, g(4)~g(7) = 0
f(8) = 27, g(8) = 3
f(9) = 27, g(9) = 5</code></pre>
<p>From the observation, to minimize the sum of g(), we must order
<code>1, 2, ...</code> from where g() &gt; 0.</p>
<p>How about f()? to max out f() as soon as possible, we need to order
<code>10, 9, ...</code> from the beginning.</p>
<p>Given the constraint <code>m &lt; k</code>, f() maxes out earlier
than g() starts having values. Therefore, we can start with a decreasing
subarray, and end with an increasing subarray to minimize g().</p>
<pre><code>for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i &lt; n - m:
            res.append(n - i)
        else:
            res.append(i - n + m + 1)
    print(&quot; &quot;.join([str(x) for x in res]))</code></pre>
