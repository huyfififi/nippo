- Update the Mastodon version v4.2.8 -> v4.2.10
	- Because I have no knowledge on Ruby on Rails, I always get scared when merging the main branch of mastodon/mastodon and resolving conflicts. If things break, I would quit hosting an instance.
- Read the first chapter of "Just for Fun."
	- I already begain to understand his personality.
	- The talk about Finland is new to me and interesting
- Solved Codeforces problems
	- The range of the difficulty `800` is very wide. Some are too easy. Some take too much time to solve.

## [1915A. Odd One Out](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1915/A)

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a == b:
        print(c)
    elif a == c:
        print(b)
    else:
        print(a)
```

## [1915B. Not Quite Latin Square](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1915/B)

We only need to check the row which contains "?"

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    row_to_check: str = ""
    for i in range(3):
        row = input()
        if "?" in row:
            row_to_check = row

    if "A" not in row_to_check:
        print("A")
    elif "B" not in row_to_check:
        print("B")
    elif "C" not in row_to_check:
        print("C")
    else:
        raise Exception("unexpected")
```
