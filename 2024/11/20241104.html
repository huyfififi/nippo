<p><a

at main - astral-sh/uv</a></p>
<p>Four scenarios are mentioned on the page: Warm Installation, Cold
Installation, Warm Resolution, and Cold Resolution. In essence, what is
“10-100x faster than <code>pip</code>” is that dependency resolution and
package installation are much faster than any other package
managers.</p>
<p>Although its performance is quite impressive, it does not look very
appealing because dependency resolution and package installation do not
happen frequently, and even with other package managers, they don't take
much time.</p>
<p>Adding a new package to add a new functionality is rare unless I just
start a new project.</p>
<p>Updating packages is usually handled by Dependabot, and because it's
a background job, some time lag should be tolerated. Updating packages
in a hurry is very rare, and shortening package installation steps in
GitHub Actions does not move the needle.</p>
<p>Packages are cached in GitHub Actions, so dependency resolution and
package installation won't be a problem when running tests on pull
requests.</p>
<p>For me, the fact that <a href="20241101.html"><code>uv</code> is not
supported by Dependabot</a> is more concerning to me, considering the
skills and resources of my collaborators.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I should stick to <code>poetry</code>.</p>
