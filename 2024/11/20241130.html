<p>family dinner</p>
<p>Total 4000 kcal</p>
<p>30 mins jogging</p>
<p>During my lifetime, I have succeeded in losing more than 20 kg three
times, but as I get older, I seem to be losing the power to keep my
calorie intake under BMR.</p>
<p>I recall that I ate a masssive amount of protein when I managed to go
on a diet, so my next attempt is to make PFC (protein, fat, and
carbohydrate) balance more appropriate. To be more specific, I will try
to eat more than 100 g of protein, which is around 400 kcal, per day.
(It is advised to eat (weight in kg) * 1.5 ~ 2.0 g protein to nuture
muscle).</p>
<p>Protein is considered to be the most calorie-sparse nutrient, and it
can also help me feel full much earlier (and build more muscle!).
(sugar/carbohydrate and protein take very different paths to be digested
by a human body, and sugar/carbohydrate takes much less time to be
digested than protein).</p>
<hr />
<p>MUST:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the laundry</li>
<li>Resume measuring my weight</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade the Amazon Lightsail plan (take a snapshot, create a new
instance, and migrate)</li>
</ul>
