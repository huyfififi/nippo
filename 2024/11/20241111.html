Ultralytics YOLO Docs - YOLO: A Brief History</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640">YOLO</a> (You Only Look
Once), a popular object detection and image segmentation model, was
developed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi at the University of
Washington. Launched in 2015, YOLO quickly gained popularity for its
high speed and accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I bet the researcher named the algorithm after YOLO (You Only Live
Once).</p>
<p>As I checked the research paper on Google Scholar, the paper has been
cited by <strong>54035</strong>, meaning that the paper has a huge
impact on that field. The paper consists of only 10 pages, so it would
be better to read the paper later.</p>

<p>I stopped doing CV research because I saw the impact my work was
having. I loved the work but the military applications and privacy
concerns eventually became impossible to ignore.</p>

<p>It is kind of sad that he seems to be inactive on his career, but my
guess is that his work had too much impact on the world for him to
bear.</p>
<p>I might have digressed‚Ä¶ the section contains a brief history of the
YOLO series, starting from the research paper and having a variety of
improvements made to it. It's interesting that the history has not only
research papers such as <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242">YOLO9000: Better, Faster,
Stronger</a> but also <a
href="https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6">improvements by a
company</a>.</p>

YOLO11 Launch</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are thrilled to announce the official launch of YOLO11, the latest
iteration of the Ultralytics YOLO series, bringing unparalleled
advancements in real-time object detection, segmentation, pose
estimation, and classification. Building upon the success of YOLOv8,
YOLO11 delivers state-of-the-art performance across the board with
significant improvements in both speed and accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>üöÄ Key Performance Improvements:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Accuracy Boost:</strong> YOLO11 achieves up to a <strong>2%
higher mAP</strong> (mean Average Precision) on COCO for object
detection compared to YOLOv8.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Efficiency &amp; Speed:</strong> It boasts up to <strong>22%
fewer parameters</strong> than YOLOv8 models while improving real-time
inference speeds by up to 2% faster, making it perfect for edge
applications and resource-constrained environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That looks wonderful! and as I don't see any caveats in the release,
and they say it's an ‚Äúofficial launch,‚Äù I think it is a stable release,
not a beta or pre-release.</p>

href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/pagination/">Pagination
- Django REST framework</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Pagination is only performed automatically if you're using the
generic views or viewsets. If you‚Äôre using a regular APIView, you'll
need to call into the pagination API yourself to ensure you return a
paginated response.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The pagination style may be set globally, using the
<code>DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS</code> and <code>PAGE_SIZE</code> setting
keys. For example, to use the built-in limit/offset pagination, you
would do something like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    &#39;DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS&#39;: &#39;rest_framework.pagination.LimitOffsetPagination&#39;,
    &#39;PAGE_SIZE&#39;: 100
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that you need to set both the pagination class, and the page
size that should be used. Both <code>DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS</code> and
<code>PAGE_SIZE</code> are None by default.</p>
