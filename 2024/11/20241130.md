family dinner

Total 4000 kcal

30 mins jogging

During my lifetime, I have succeeded in losing more than 20 kg three times, but as I get older, I seem to be losing the power to keep my calorie intake under BMR.

I recall that I ate a masssive amount of protein when I managed to go on a diet, so my next attempt is to make PFC (protein, fat, and carbohydrate) balance more appropriate. To be more specific, I will try to eat more than 100 g of protein, which is around 400 kcal, per day. (It is advised to eat (weight in kg) * 1.5 ~ 2.0 g protein to nuture muscle).

Protein is considered to be the most calorie-sparse nutrient, and it can also help me feel full much earlier (and build more muscle!). (sugar/carbohydrate and protein take very different paths to be digested by a human body, and sugar/carbohydrate takes much less time to be digested than protein).
