## [2039A. Shohag Loves Mod - 800](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2039/A)

Is the difficulty really 800? The problem felt very difficult...

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    res: list[int] = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res.append(2 * i - 1)
    print(" ".join(str(x) for x in res))
```

By looking at the constraint, my idea is to simply construct an array with mod values [1, 2, 3, ...] \(except the first element for simplicity).

I think the problem with my diet is a lack of protein. After eating things in the shelf, I will increase the proportion of protein gradually.
