<ul>
<li>Tried to improve the function to build a suffix array <a
href="20241107.html">20241107</a> with a radix sort, but it was too
difficult. I’m not great with algorithms.
<ul>
<li>I will skip it for now, hoping I will get more understanding of
suffix arrays later.</li>

<h2 id="my-thoughts-pythondjango-vs-flaskfastapigo">My Thoughts:
Python/Django vs Flask/FastAPI/Go</h2>
<p>What I love about Django is that it’s ‘batteries included,’ meaning
it comes with most of the functionality we need built-in, so we don’t
require many additional dependencies.</p>
<p>Different from Django, Flask and FastAPI aim to provide minimal
functionalities to build Web API and leave room for developers to choose
what additional libraries to install.</p>
<p>However, the process of maintaining dependencies has been challenging
to me. A licensing issue may arise, or some packages are not actively
maintained, so I’m forced to look for alternatives or sometimes directly
work on the project on GitHub.</p>
<p>By using Django, I can reduce the time to maintain the project
dependencies, as it provides many resources and release/LTS plans. For
most beginners/startups, I would say Django is the best option to avoid
unnecessary headaches.</p>
<p>I myself am not familiar with Go yet, but as I talked with my friend
and did some programming with it, I realized that software development
with Go feels similar to Flask/FastAPI’s principle to let developers add
dependencies freely. Go itself has a mechanism to manage dependencies,
unlike Python, but there are few dominant players/libraries out there,
and getting familiar with the API of dependencies and managing them
correctly seemed to be hard.</p>
<h2 id="memo-designing-data-intensive-applications-chapter-1">MEMO:
Designing Data-Intensive Applications Chapter 1</h2>
<p>In this book, data systems are considered in three aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Systems should have some tolerance for some <em>faults</em> and
continue working correctly even when facing some anomalies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Systems shuold be able to scale depending on the requirements to
cope with increased load.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Maintainability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Systems should be kept in a way that team members can work on them
without enormous difficulties.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the later chapters, they will be dug deeper with concrete
examples.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…in some cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) it is
fairly common for virtual machine instances to become unavailable
without warning, as the platforms are designed to prioritize flexibility
and elasticity over single-machine reliability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have experienced that AWS instances are not very reliable when
running as a single server or a limited number of servers (EC2,
Lightsail, and others). This statement concisely expresses their nature
and clicked my brain.</p>
<p>The author recommends to use “percentile” to monitor performance
(response time).</p>
<p>SLO (service level obectives) SLA (service level agreements)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some system are <em>elastic</em>, meaning that they can automatically
add computing resources when they detect a load increase, whereas other
systems are scaled manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of “elastic” might be new to me.</p>
