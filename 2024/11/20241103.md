## [2036A. Quintomania - 800](https://codeforces.com/contest/2036/problem/A#)

Nothing to note

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    a: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if abs(a[i + 1] - a[i]) not in (5, 7):
            print("NO")
            break
    else:
        print("YES")
```

## [2036B. Startup - 800](https://codeforces.com/contest/2036/problem/B)

My submission has been hacked and exceeded the time limit.

[#1097423](https://codeforces.com/contest/2036/hacks/1097423)

```python
from collections import defaultdict


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

    d = defaultdict(int)
    for _ in range(k):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        d[b] += c

    print(sum(sorted(d.values(), reverse=True)[:n]))
```

but my solution seems to be the same as the one on the editorial, and its time complexity should be O(klogk). sorted() uses Timsort...

I tried to browse others\' solutions, but Codeforces does not offer a convenient UI for that.

My gut feeling is that there is a pitfall when using Python, as Python is not a good language for competitive programming, but it may not be that important for me right now. I want to focus on data structures & algorithms, not useful techniques for competitive programming.
