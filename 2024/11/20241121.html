(OOP)</h2>
<p>NOTE: This is just a random thought of mine, and I don’t have any
evidence or references to back it up. The idea just clicked with me
while I was taking a shower.</p>
<p>As I read many books, I found that object-oriented programming (OOP)
is defined in various ways. In my opinion, the fundamental ideai s to
model data similarly to how we handle real-life objects.</p>
<p>More specifically, data should be treated as an object that has a
state and actions. For example, consider a purse. A purse has a state,
such as the amount of money it holds or the number of bills inside. It
also supports actions, like withdrawing money.</p>
<p>In OOP, a class serves as a blueprint for defining such objects. A
class can have attributes to represent its state and methods to define
its actions, enabling us to create and manipulate objects in a
structured way.</p>
