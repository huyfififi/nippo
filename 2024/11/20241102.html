<ul>
<li>Participated in Codeforces Round 984 (Div. 3)
<ul>
<li>I could not come up with any approaches for the C problem.</li>
<li>I will review the problems later.</li>
<li>Great job. Although it's not fun, I took time to be out of my
comfort zone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Finished two pictures
<ul>
<li>Drawing pictures sort of works as meditation for me, as most of the
time, it’s a kind of easy and repetitive task.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>As I mulled it over, honesty (I could not find the right word for the
Japanese phrase 誠実さ, but honesty means almost the same, I guess.) is
one of my most important values. When people say they want to improve
themselves as software engineers (or others) while they don't take the
right action, I feel that my brain cells are getting angrier.</p>
