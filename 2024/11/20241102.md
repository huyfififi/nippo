- Participated in Codeforces Round 984 (Div. 3)
	- I could not come up with any approaches for the C problem.
	- I will review the problems later.
	- Great job. Although it\'s not fun, I took time to be out of my comfort zone.
- Finished two pictures
	- Drawing pictures sort of works as meditation for me, as most of the time, it's a kind of easy and repetitive task.

As I mulled it over, honesty (I could not find the right word for the Japanese phrase 誠実さ, but honesty means almost the same, I guess.) is one of my most important values.
When people say they want to improve themselves as software engineers (or others) while they don\'t take the right action, I feel that my brain cells are getting angrier.
