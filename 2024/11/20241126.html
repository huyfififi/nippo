<p>I’m sleepy… and hungry… someone… save me…</p>
<p>I’m good at understanding characters, but mathematics isn’t exactly
my strong suit. I enjoy reading books in my free time, but as a
programmer, I feel I should dedicate more time to data structures and
algorithms. I want to be better at competitive programming…</p>
<p>I feel like some dots in my brain about computer science and software
engineering are finally connecting. I wasted a lot of time pursuing
goals that were too difficult, but I’m glad I made it to this point.
Keep going!</p>
<ul>
<li>Made progress in reading “Desining Data-Intensive Applications”
<ul>
<li>This book is mesmerizing, but if I would find it awfully tedious. To
enjoy something, experience or knowledge is required.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-effect Transistor (MOSFET, MOS-FET,
or MOS FET) is a field-effect transistor (FET with an insulated gate)
where the voltage determines the conductivity of the device.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is used for switching or amplifying signals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3D SEQUENTIAL integration (3DSI) enables an active device to be
stacked on another device in a sequential way to exxtend the
capabilities of traditional plannar technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this letter, we evaluate whether the additional process steps
required to fabricate the upper-layer transistor affects the radiation
response of already-built transistors in the bottom layers of 3DSI
FD-SOI (fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator) MOSFETs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These results strongly suggest that the additional processing steps
required to achieve 3D integration have little effect on the resulting
charge trapping and border-trap densities in the gate and/or buried
oxides of these devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These results are quite promising for the future development of
highly-integrated, 3D technologies for space applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the authors reported, 3D stacking has little effect on radiation
response, suggesting that this technique can be utilized for chips used
in space, offering more options for space applications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simple, unified interface to multiple Generative AI providers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><code>aisuite</code> makes it easy for developers to use multiple LLM
through a standardized interface. Using an interface similar to
OpenAI’s, <code>aisuite</code> makes it easy to interact with the most
popular LLMs and compare the results.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently supported providers are - OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Google,
AWS, Groq, Mistral, HuggingFace and Ollama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project is impressive, but there are some considerations for
production use.</p>
<ul>
<li>The author is a very famous researcher, but it’s unclear that the
package continues to be actively maintained.
<ul>
<li>He seems not to maintain his other projects actively.</li>
<li>The <code>aisuite</code> package has only one release yet, lacking
track records.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The library is primarily focused on chat completions and lacks other
functionalities.
<ul>
<li>It says “Today, the library is primarily focussed on chat
completions.”</li>

<p>One of my follower reported an issue that he does not receive my
posts. He is on onsen-musume.fun, so I searched the string in logs.</p>
<pre><code>I, [2024-11-12T13:00:24.983756 #7]  INFO -- : Rejected Announce activity https://onsen-musume.fun/notes/a0i0y3ay6aow2vnb/activity from https://onsen-musume.fun/users/8l6kpzosrf</code></pre>
<p>I googled it and also browsed GitHub Issues/Discussions in
mastodon/mastodon, but I didn’t see any relevant ones. The error is
reported when setting up relays, but I don’t use relays.</p>
<p>I checked whether I blocked or muted the user</p>
<pre><code>docker exec -it db psql --user mastodon
\dt  # list tables

select a.username, a.domain from accounts a, mutes m where m.target_account_id=a.id;</code></pre>
<p>but I don’t see any anomalies. I think I have to rely on other users
to help me out.</p>
