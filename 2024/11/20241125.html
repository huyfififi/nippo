the Effects of Autonomous Mobile Robot on Pedestrian Behavior‚Äù</h2>
<p>They propose this method: first, they get pedestrians‚Äô trajectory
data under two scenarios: one is an auto robot present, and he other is
an auto robot absent, and then, they compare parameters modeled with the
Social Force Model to see the effect of a robot‚Äôs presence on human
behaviors.</p>
<p>They performed 20 sets of experiments with 15 people. I will ask the
author about her experience with the experiments next time I see
her.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05779">LightRAG: Simple and Fast
Retrieval-Augmented Generation</a></p>
<p>My friend, who is pursuing a Ph.D.¬†in AI, says that the AI field is
evolving so quickly that researchers don‚Äôt wait for journals to accept
their papers. Instead, they publish them on arXiv to share their work
with others as soon as possible. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs 100% true, but it
makes sense.</p>
<p>This might be the case for this paper; I only find this paper on
arXiv now.</p>
<p>It seems LightRAG is a (sort of) improved version of GraphRAG, so I
need to check it first.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130">From Local to Global: A
Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization</a></p>
<p><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/">Welcome -
GraphRAG</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>GraphRAG is a structured, hierarchical approach to Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG), as opposed to naive semantic-search
approaches using plain text snippets. The GraphRAG process involves
extracting a knowledge graph out of raw text, building a community
hierarchy, generating summaries for these communities, and then
leveraging these structures when perform RAG-based tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I worked on simple RAG systems in the past, and from my experience, I
feel that the knowledge stored in the database is very independent and
fractured with a simple RAG.</p>
<p>GraphRAG addresses the problem by constructing a graph to take
relationships/relevance between knowledge into account.</p>

<p>üò≠ <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16130">GraphRAG</a> is good
and powerful, but the official <a
href="https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag/tree/main">implementation</a>
is difficult/painful to read or hack.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>üòä This project provides a smaller, faster, cleaner GraphRAG, while
remaining the core functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, this implementation seems to be used in the LightRAG
implementation</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not an AI researcher, and my initial understanding
must be incorrect.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs impressive that the GitHub repository has around 10k stars even
though the paper and the repo have been published last month (arXiv: Oct
8 2024). My guess is that the LightRAG is trending in the space.</p>
<p>I skimmed the paper and the repository, but I could not understand
what makes LightRAG special than GraphRAG (maybe I lack the fundamental
knowledge), but as the figure 1 suggests, the approach consists of
graph-based text indexing and dual-level retrieval paradigm (using both
low-level keys and high-level keys).</p>
<p>Since the implementation just emerged last month, I‚Äôm reluctant to
use it in production. I think we can wait for a bit and see if there are
real-life adaptions.</p>
