AD/LDAP Delegated Authentication - Username Above 52 Characters Security
Advisory</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a vulnerability was internally identified in
generating the cache key for AD/LDAP DelAuth. The Bcrypt algorithm was
used to generate the cache key where we hash a combined string of userId
+ username + password. During specific conditions, this could allow
users to authenticate by only providing the username with the stored
cache key of a previous successful authentication.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: A precondition for this vulnerability is that the username must
be or exceed 52 characters any time a cache key is generated for the
user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The precondition to have 52 or more characters for a username looks
super simple, especially in a famous security company like Okta, but
that kind of thing happens sometimes. I think disclosing mistakes is key
to getting customers to believe in the business (or anything).</p>
<h2 id="is-uv-supported-by-github-dependabot-as-of-nov-2-2024">Is
<code>uv</code> supported by GitHub Dependabot? (as of Nov 2 2024)</h2>
<p>Motivation: There is a discussion to migrate <code>poetry</code>
-&gt; <code>uv</code> as <code>uv</code> is getting tractions from the
industry, providing super-fast implementation of Python package (or say,
project) management. Last time I checked, there is no native support by
Dependabot, and because Dependagot is so useful to keep packages
up-to-date and patch security issues, I prefer not to switch to
<code>uv</code> if it still lacks support by Dependabot.</p>
<p><a

bots | uv</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Support for uv is not yet available. Progress can be tracked at:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#uvlock">Working
on projects | uv</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>uv.lock is a cross-platform lockfile that contains exact information
about your project's dependencies. Unlike the pyproject.toml which is
used to specify the broad requirements of your project, the lockfile
contains the exact resolved versions that are installed in the project
environment. This file should be checked into version control, allowing
for consistent and reproducible installations across machines.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>uv.lock is a human-readable TOML file but is managed by uv and should
not be edited manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to <code>poetry.lock</code> in <code>poetry</code>,
<code>uv.lock</code> is the lock file of all the dependencies in a
project. As I see this issue in the GitHub repository of Dependabot</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/10478">Support
updating <code>uv.lock</code> #10478</a></p>
<p>It's still open, and I don't see any related pull request, so I can
say it's not supported by Dependabot at the moment.</p>
<p>There seem to be another way to lock dependencies with
<code>uv</code>, <code>uv pip compile</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compile/">Locking environments
| uv</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>uv allows dependencies to be locked in the requirements.txt
format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, as I see the issue and pull request in the Dependabot
repository</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/10039">Support
python uv as pip-compile compatible replacement #10039</a></p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/10040">Support
uv compiled requirements files #10040</a></p>
<p>They are still in review. It is interesting that the pull request was
created around five months ago and have been staled.</p>
<p>Maybe the Dependabot team does not have enough resources? Do they
just don't like the idea to support <code>uv</code>? I browsed the
thread but could not figure out.</p>
<p>The author communicated in a polite manner even though he has been
(sort of) ignored. I respect the his attitude… I cannot guarantee that I
wouldn’t go mad if I were in his shoes.</p>
<p>TODO: I know <code>uv</code> is super-fast, but is it important?
