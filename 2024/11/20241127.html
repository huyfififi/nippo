id="visual-discomfort-and-glare-assessment-in-office-environments-a-review-of-light-induced-physiological-and-perceptual-responses">Visual
discomfort and glare assessment in office environments: A review of
light-induced physiological and perceptual responses</h2>
<p>This survey paper analyzes existing research on discomfort glare,
evaluating the reliability of conventional measurements and metrics.
Additionally, it suggests future directions for research in this
field.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>5.1 Very promising (established factors)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Relative Pupil size: Inversely correlated with visual discomfort
ratings, correlated with vertical illuminance at the eye and glare
indices.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>5.2 Just statistically significant (require further
investigation)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pupillary unrest (hippus): Affected by the luminance intensity</li>
<li>Eye Movements: Compared favourably with subjective assessment</li>
<li>Spontaneous eye Blink Rate: Affected by glare while the subject is
looking slightly upwards</li>
<li>Degree of eye-opening: Applicable in the presence of direct
sunlight; correlated highly with vertical eye illuminance, DGP and PGSV;
exhibited better diagnostic performance than DGI, DGP, or vertical
illuminance at the eye</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>5.3 Irrelevant</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Absolute pupil diameter: Correlated with overall background
luminance.</li>
<li>Gaze position/direction: Heavily depends on the cognitive demand and
complexity of the task, unsuitable as a predictor for discomfort
glare.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-you-shouldnt-create-indexes-for-all-sql-columns">Why You
Shouldn’t Create Indexes For All SQL Columns</h2>
<p>Whey my friend asked me why we could not create indexes for all the
columns in our SQL database, I could not answer that question clearly. I
mulled over, and here is the answer I would say now.</p>
<p>Although indexes can make queries faster, they also may have negative
impacts on our database.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indexes consume disk space, and creating unnecessary indexes can
lead to signficant storage overhead.</li>
<li>Every time a row is inserted, updated, or deleted, the associated
indexes must also be updated. Therefore, having many indexes can slow
those operations down unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Having indexes in rarely-used columns can confuse collaborators that
those columns are frequently used to perform searches.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, the friend dislikes dynamic typing programing languages
but loves NoSQL, saying that NoSQL is easier to use.</p>
<p>I find it very inconsistent.</p>
<p>For programming languages, he seeks some sort of validation or
safeguards, but he does not want it for databases. I will write more
about this, but from my experience, business-related data is not (or
should not) dynamic in most cases. I have suffered from how easily data
in NoSQL is out of structure and malformed.</p>

<p><a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/136523">Editorial of
CodeTON Round 9 (Div. 1 + Div. 2)</a></p>
<p>The editorial explains the approach in detail. I love it.</p>
<p>I had similar thoughts and observations, but failed to reach the
answer. It is somewhat frustrating, but gaining EXP is a good thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THOUGHT: The condition seems hard to track. So a good way is to play
around with smaller cases and see if we can make some observations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ACTION: Let’s start with the smallest string… (len(s’) = 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ACTION: Let’s try the next smallest strings… (len(s’) = 2) I
overlooked this part somehow!</p>
