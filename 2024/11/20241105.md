## [2036C. Anya and 1100 - 900](https://codeforces.com/contest/2036/problem/C)

[Codeforces Round 984 (Div.3) Editorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/135849)

> Hint

> With each query, to track the change in the presence of “1100” in a row, you don\'t have to go through the entire row — you can check just a few neighboring cells.

That makes sense, and I took time to come up with a solution, but it was too hard for me.

> Tutorial

> First, in a naive way, let\'s count `count` - the number of times "1100" occurs in `s`.

> Then, for each of `q` queries we will update `count`: consider the substring `s[max(1, i - 3);min(i + 3, n)] before changing `s\_i` and find `before` - the number of times that "1100" occurs in it. Then update `s\_i = v` and simiilarly find `after` - the number of times that "1100" occurs in `s[max(1, i - 3);min(i + 3, n)]` after applying the query.

> Thus, by doing `count = count + (after - before)`, we get the number of times that "1100" occurs in `s` after the query is applied. If `count > 0`, the answer to the query is "YES", otherwise it is "NO".

It just makese sense!!

```python
TARGET_STRING = "1100"
TARGET_LENGTH = len(TARGET_STRING)


for _ in range(int(input())):
    s: list[str] = list(input())
    q: int = int(input())

    count: int = "".join(s).count(TARGET_STRING)
    for _ in range(q):
        i, v = input().split()
        i = int(i) - 1

        before: int = "".join(
            s[max(i - TARGET_LENGTH + 1, 0) : i + TARGET_LENGTH]
        ).count(TARGET_STRING)
        s[i] = v
        after: int = "".join(
            s[max(i - TARGET_LENGTH + 1, 0) : i + TARGET_LENGTH]
        ).count(TARGET_STRING)

        count += after - before

        if count > 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
```

## [Mozilla Foundation lays off about third of staff - The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/06/mozilla_foundation_layoffs/)

> While Mozilla Foundation declined to quantify the number of people being let go, it reported 60 employees on its 2022 Form 990 disclosure, which was filed November 15, 2023. *The Register* understands the current headcount is closer to 120, so presumably around 36 people stand to lose their jobs.

[Mozilla Corporation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation)

> Number of employees: ~750 (2020)

I found it interesting that the Mozilla Foundation operates with a very limited number of employees, though its subsidiary has a moderate number of people.
