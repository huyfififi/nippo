<ul>
<li>Moved into a new apartment</li>
<li>Cleaned the previous room before moving out</li>
<li>It’s been three years since I last played badminton, but my body
still remembers how to play.</li>
<li>Enjoyed some social life</li>
<li>Got some furniture from IKEA and assembled them.
<ul>
<li>I did it on my own, though the directions say at least two persons
are required to assemble.</li>
<li>I’m tired.</li>

<li>Slept to get distracted from reality</li>
<li>Chores</li>

<li>Browsed the paper “You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object
Detection”</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Current detection systems repurpose classifiers to perform detection.
To detect an object, these systems take a classifier for that object and
evaluate it at various locations and scales in a test imaage. Systems
like deformable parts models (DPM) use a sliding window approach where
the classifier is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire
image.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We reframe object detection as a single regression problem, straight
from image pixels to bouding box coordinates and class probabilities.
Using our system, you only look once (YOLO) at an image to predict what
objects are present and where they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We implement this model as a convolutional neural network and
evaluate it on the <em>PASCAL</em> VOC detection dataset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unifying the complicated process that conventional approaches use
with a neural network seems to be the appealing point of this
research.</p>
<p>To fully understand the model, I should study neural networks
first.</p>

<p>MUST:</p>
<ul>
<li>Print out “You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection”
by Joseph Redmon (20241122)</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved suffix array</li>
<li>Upgrade the Amazon Lightsail plan (take a snapshot, create a new
instance, and migrate)</li>
