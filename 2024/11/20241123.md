- Helped my friend to move out
	- This was the first time I used U-Haul. It was a good experience.
- Spent some time with my friends
	- I don't hang out with my friends often, but it's good sometimes.
	- Spoke English
- Duolingo/English words
- Read some sections in Alain's propos
	- I'm reading it in Japanese, but it's almost impossible to understand what he tries to say
	- Super boring so far
- Started reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"
	- I remember my mentor was reading this book five years ago. I gained some experience, and the content now sounds familiar (to some extent).

I'm very sleepy... I wanted to write down some findings or summary of what I browsed today, but my brain seems to reject doing that. Good night.
