## Tamagotchi

Tamagotchi got popular among Japanese software developers because the Tamagotchi team released a blog about how they use AWS to build the complex system.

I browsed the Tamagotchi website today and found that there is a web page to list OSS they use. It\'s rare that a project for children discloses such technical details.

I\'m considering ordering one for myself. It\'s not that expensive ($59 before tax).

## [1941C. Rudolf and the Ugly String](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1941/C)

I cannot simply use memoization because it involves string manipulations.

For example,

```
memo = {}


def min_removal(s: str) -> int:
    if s in memo:
        return memo[s]

    if "pie" not in s and "map" not in s:
        memo[s] = 0
        return 0

    res = 10 ** 7
    for i in range(len(s)):
        res = min(res, min_removal(s[:i] + s[i+1:]) + 1)
    memo[s] = res
    return res


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(min_removal(s))
```

if the length of the input string s is n, the creation of a substring s[:i] + s[i+1:] costs O(n), making the total time complexity ~= O(n^2)? which is not suitable for the constraints of this problem.

I\'ll try to come up with a tabulation solution tomorrow.
