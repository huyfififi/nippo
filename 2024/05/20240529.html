<h2 id="ietf-the-internet-engineering-task-force">IETF (The Internet
Engineering Task Force)</h2>
<p>IETF (The Internet Engineering Task Force) is responsible for the
development and management of internet standards.</p>
<p>I was not aware that they have an RFC document on their own
mission.</p>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3935">RFC 3935: A
Mission Statement for the IETF</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of the IETF is to make the Internet work better.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mission of the IETF is to produce high quality, relevant
technical and engineering documents that influence the way people
design, use, and manage the Internet in such a way as to make the
Internet work better. These documents include protocol standards, best
current practices, and informational documents of various kinds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Open process</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>any interested person can participate in the work, know what is being
decided, and make his or her voice heard on the issue. Part of this
principle is our commitment to making our documents, our WG mailing
lists, our attendance lists, and our meeting minutes publicly available
on the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Technical competence</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the issues on which the IETF produces its documents are issues where
the IETF has the competence needed to speak to them, and that the IETF
is willing to listen to technically competent input from any source.
Technical competence also means that we expect IETF output to be
designed to sound network engineering principles - this is also often
referred to as “engineering quality”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Volunteer Core</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>our participants and our leadership are people who come to the IETF
because they want to do work that furthers the IETF’s mission of “making
the Internet work better”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rough consensus and running code</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We make standards based on the combined engineering judgement of our
participants and our real-world experience in implementing and deploying
our specifications.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Protocol ownership</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when the IETF takes ownership of a protocol or function, it accepts
the responsibility for all aspects of the protocol, even though some
aspects may rarely or never be seen on the Internet. Conversely, when
the IETF is not responsible for a protocol or function, it does not
attempt to exert control over it, even though it may at times touch or
affect the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">IETF:
Introduction</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IETF publishes its technical documentation as RFCs, an acronym
for their historical title Requests for Comments. RFCs are sequentially
numbered, starting with RFC 1 published in 1969 (the RFC series predates
the IETF). Each RFC has a status, generally one of ‘Internet Standard’,
‘Proposed Standard’, ‘Best Current Practice’ (or ‘BCP’ in short),
‘Informational’, ‘Experimental’ or ‘Historic’. Some statuses may change
over time. RFCs are freely available.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The RFC series has two sub-series, STDs and BCPs, with each numbered
STD and BCP comprising one or more RFCs. STDs are ‘Internet Standard’
RFCs and BCPs are RFCs that describe Best Current Practices in the
Internet, some of which are administrative processes for the IETF.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once an RFC is published, it is never revised. If the specification
it describes changes, the standard will be re-published in another RFC
that “obsoletes” the first. If a technical or editorial error is found
in an RFC, an errata may be linked to the RFC and/or held for the next
document update.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The authoritative repository of RFCs is the <a
href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/">RFC Editor</a> website.</p>
