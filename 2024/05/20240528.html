<p>Closed port 443 of the VPS instance I created yesterday for now.</p>
<p>It's interesting that though I use the same VPS plan (2 GB RAM, 2
vCPUs, 60 GB SSD) as my Mastodon server, the newly created one for a
simple dashboard web application's CPU usage is around 20%. The mastodon
one only uses around 2%. I'm not sure if I made some mistakes or
Mastodon is highly optimized. Another factor can be OS; I use Amazon
Linux for the new one whereas I chose Ubuntu for the existing one. I'll
keep an eye on the metricsto see if I get the answer for that.</p>
<h2 id="port-22-80-and-443">Port 22, 80, and 443</h2>
<p>I know that (although it can be changed,) SSH uses port 22, HTTP uses
port 80, and HTTPS uses port 443, but I have little knowledge of them
and decided to dig a little bit deeper.</p>
<h3 id="port-22-ssh-secure-shell">Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/port">SSH Academy: The story
of the SSH port is 22</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Secure Shell protocol is a method for securely sending commands
to a computer over and unsecured network. SSH uses cryptography to
authenticate and encrypt connections between devices[<a
href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/">1</a>].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tatu Ylönen, the inventor of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol shared
an interesting story of how the project got port 22 in the web page.</p>
<p>He was thinking about replacing both telnet (port 23) and ftp (port
21) with SSH and found that port 22 was free.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I figured having that port number might be one of those small things
that would give some aura of credibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the early stage of the internet, IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority) has been responsible for allocation and management of port
numberes, and Tatu sent an email to ask for the port number, and they
just assigned the number to SSH!.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1340">RFC
1340</a> published in July 1992, port 22 was unassigned.</p>
<pre><code>ftp-data         20/tcp    File Transfer [Default Data]      [96,JBP]

ftp              21/tcp    File Transfer [Control]           [96,JBP]

<p>It continued to be empty in RFC 1700, and port numbers stopped
maintained by RFC. RFC 3232 states that RFC 1700 and its predecessors
would no longer be updated via RFCs but through the IANA's online
registry.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml">IANA:
Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry</a></p>
<p>On this registry, port 22 is assigned to ssh (<a
href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4251.html">RFC 4251 The Secure
Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture</a>).</p>
<h3 id="port-80-http-port-443-https">Port 80: HTTP, Port 443: HTTPS</h3>
<p>Similarly, the port numbers are maintained/managed by IANA.</p>

<p>When HTTP/TLS is being run over a TCP/IP connection, the default port
is 443.</p>

<h2 id="actionscache-in-github-actions">actions/cache in GitHub
Actions</h2>
<p>Problem: We prepare a test database by running all migrations every
time CI runs tests in GitHub Actions. It takes too much time!</p>
<p>Browsed <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows">Caching
dependencies to speed up workflows</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Workflow runs often reuse the same outputs or downloaded dependencies
from one run to another. For example, package and dependency management
tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, and Yarn keep a local cache of
downloaded dependencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first glance, the action: cache is for caching dependencies and
that sort, so dumping database and reusing it is not the expected
usage.</p>
<p>I googled the caching of database dump in GitHub Actions, but could
not find popular articles about that. Unfortunately, we currently don't
have sufficient resources to look into this carefully, I decided not to
utilize the action <code>cache</code> for the time being. It seems to be
beyond the basic usage, and I don't think we can manage it properly even
if we make it work.</p>
<p>However, I found one thing we did not take advantage of: caching pip
dependencies</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python?tab=readme-ov-file#caching-packages-dependencies">actions/setup-python:
Caching packages dependencies</a></p>
<pre><code>steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: &#39;3.9&#39;
    cache: &#39;pip&#39; # caching pip dependencies
- run: pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
<p>I’ll see if it works -&gt; we use docker in GitHub Actions
environment as a walkaround, and the step <code>setup-python</code> does
not exist. I will try to use it later.</p>
