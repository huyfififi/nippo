<h2 id="お金の減らし方---森博嗣">お金の減らし方 - 森博嗣</h2>
<p>Read “お金の減らし方 (How to spend money(?))” by Hiroshi Mori. The
topic is akin to “Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life”
by Luke Burgis (I highly recommend the book), and its main message is
that people tend to spend money to impress others, but we should spend
money on what we truly want to satisfy ourselves.</p>
<p>The problem is that most of us don't know what we genuinely
desire.</p>
<p>After reading this book, I mulled over what I could do to find what
I'm passionate about, but couldn't think of anything. I think I enjoy
programming now, so I guess I better continue to work on it for the time
being.</p>
