<p>I was creating a document about a feature that consists of multiple
components, such as a message broker, backend, and frontend.</p>
<p>I provided a brief summary of the system architecture and asked
Chat-GPT4o to generate an image of its high-level overview. As a result,
a completely meaningless image was generated :joy: I tried different
prompts multiple times, but couldn't get it to generate an image with
meaningful information. All images have random characters on them. I
need to create one manually with app.diagram.net.</p>

Programming</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pair Programming
<ul>
<li>Two programmers work together at one workstation. One programmer
writes code while ther other reviews the code as it is written. The two
programmers switch roles frequently.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mob Programming (Ensemble Programming)
<ul>
<li>The entire team works together on the same task on the same
computer. The team collaborates continuously, discussing and
implementing code collectively.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm with a company with a remote work culture, and we're trying to
facilitate collaborations/communications by leveraging them.</p>
<p>Although I don't have enough knowledge of that, I'm thinking about
starting with introducing more pair programming sessions. In a remote
work culture, keeping everyone engaged and sessions concise should be
very hard.</p>
