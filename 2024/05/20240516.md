Participated in a session about RAG presented by AI startups, but the content was obscure and not helpful for me.

It was a tough day handling many things.

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

I\'ve been looking into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to create more accurate and contextually aware natural language understanding and generation systems.

RAG is particularly useful for tasks like question answering, information retrieval, and knowledge-based text generation.

The retrieval-based part finds relevant knowledge (documents or passages) from (vector) database and passes them to the generation-based part. Then, the generator component uses the information to form more accurate answers.

## Codeforces API

I\'m thinking about creating a dashboard where I show related data of me such as Codeforces rating.

Here are the APIs I might want to use

### [user.rating](https://codeforces.com/apiHelp/methods#user.rating)

[https://codeforces.com/api/user.rating?handle=utsu\_boy](https://codeforces.com/api/user.rating?handle=utsu_boy)

### [user.status](https://codeforces.com/apiHelp/methods#user.status)

[https://codeforces.com/api/user.status?handle=utsu\_boy&from=1&count=1000](https://codeforces.com/api/user.status?handle=utsu_boy&from=1&count=1000)
