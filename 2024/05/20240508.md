# 20240508

I bought my first curved monitor, which cost over $200 (!). So far, my experience with it has been great. High resolution. Unique experience.

Today was a busy day. I feel a bit tired.

At first glance, Topological sort comes to my mind but its difficulty is 800, and I doubt I need to implement an algorithm with Topological sort. 

It turned out it\'s just an implementation problem, as

```
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

func minInvitation(n int, p []int) int {
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		if i == p[p[i]-1]-1 {
			return 2
		}
	}
	return 3
}

func main() {
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	scanner.Scan()
	t, _ := strconv.Atoi(scanner.Text())

	for tc := 0; tc < t; tc++ {
		scanner.Scan()
		n, _ := strconv.Atoi(scanner.Text())
		var p []int = make([]int, n)
		scanner.Scan()
		for i, piStr := range strings.Split(scanner.Text(), " ") {
			p[i], _ = strconv.Atoi(piStr)
		}
		fmt.Println(minInvitation(n, p))
	}
}
```

This problem reminds me that I was not the best friend of my best friends.
