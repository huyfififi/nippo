Finished implementing the API that I needed in this phase. Moved on to the frontend development.

Browsed MUI ([mui.com](mui.com)), which my friend recommended.

> MUI offers a comprehensive suite of free UI tools to help you ship new features faster. Start with Material UI, our fully-loaded component library, or bring your own design system to our production-ready components.

> Material UI is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design.

So, MUI seems to provide ready-to-use React components, and I don\'t have to worry about CSS with this.

For my use case, [Card](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-card/) seems to suit. It can be used to display a single content. Also [Typography](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/typography/) is easy to use as it comes with default CSS, and I use it in the card components.
