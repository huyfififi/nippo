<p>I always start a day thinking, “I feel a bit tired. Maybe I better
slack off a little bit,” but I end up hardworking and exhausted.</p>
<p>It's a known fact that once you manage to start doing something, you
can continue it for a while; only the initial hurdle is high.</p>
<p>It's called “作業興奮” in Japan though it's not backed by scientific
research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced size of docker container images in our infrastructure by <a

tags</a></li>
<li>Added minimal test templates and configured GitHub Actions with it
(CI)
<ul>
<li>My personal project was a very good reference to write the YAML file
for it.</li>

<h3 id="http-hypertext-transfer-protocol">HTTP (HyperText Transfer
Protocol)</h3>
<p>HTTP is a method computers and servers use to request and send data
such as text and images.</p>
<p>(When someone visit a web page, their browser sends an HTTP request
to the server, where the web page is hosted, to fetch the content of the
web page. Then, the web server sends an HTTP response back to the web
browser, with the text, images, or other data.)</p>
<h3 id="http0.9">HTTP/0.9</h3>
<p>The original HTTP was implemented as a prototype by World Wide Web
initiative (Tim Berners-Lee and his team) in 1991. This version is known
as HTTP/0.9, but the number was assigned after its implementation.</p>
<p>As we can see in the web page[3], its definition looks fairly
simple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTTP/0.9 was extremely simple: requests consisted of a single line
and started with the only possible method GET followed by the path to
the resource[2].</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>GET /mypage.html</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The response was extremely simple, too: it only consisted of the file
itself[2].</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  A very simple HTML page
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<h3 id="http1.0-http1.1">HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1</h3>
<p>HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 are developed in parallel; HTTP/1.0 is a result
of experimental development, HTTP/1.1 is the first standardized version
of HTTP published in 1997.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 1991-1995, these (new features) were introduced with a
try-and-see approach. In the meantime, proper standardization was in
progress. This happened in parallel to the diverse implementations of
HTTP/1.0. The first standardized version of HTTP, HTTP/1.1, was
published in early 1997, only a few months after HTTP/1.0[2].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They introduced numerous improvements such as status code or the
concept of HTTP headers.</p>
<p>After published as RFC 2068 (the first version of HTTP/1.1)[5] in
January 1997, HTTP/1.1 continued to be used for more than 15 years until
the release of HTTP/2, which was published in June 2014[2].</p>
<h3 id="http2">HTTP/2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created. HTTP/2
solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not
anticipate. In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than
HTTP/1.1. One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it
prioritizes content during the loading process[1].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>cf: Multiplexing, Server push, Header Compression</p>
<h3 id="http3">HTTP/3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The next major version of HTTP, HTTP/3 has the same semantics as
earlier versions of HTTP but uses QUIC instead of TCP for the transport
layer portion… QUIC is designed to provide much lower latency for HTTP
connections… By October 2022, 26% of all websites were using
HTTP/3[2].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can check [7], HTTP/3 is supported by most major browsers.</p>
