## お金の減らし方 - 森博嗣

Read "お金の減らし方 (How to spend money(?))" by Hiroshi Mori. The topic is akin to "Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life" by Luke Burgis (I highly recommend the book), and its main message is that people tend to spend money to impress others, but we should spend money on what we truly want to satisfy ourselves.

The problem is that most of us don\'t know what we genuinely desire.

After reading this book, I mulled over what I could do to find what I\'m passionate about, but couldn\'t think of anything. I think I enjoy programming now, so I guess I better continue to work on it for the time being.
