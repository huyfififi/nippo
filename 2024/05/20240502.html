<ul>
<li>participated in Codeforces Round 943 (Div. 3)
<ul>
<li>solved 3 problems (personal best)</li>
<li>Contests in codeforces happen too early in the morning (7:30/45 am),
not suitable for people in the Bay Area</li>
</ul></li>
<li>enabled GitHub pages
<ul>
<li>TODO: consider using my domain for the GitHub pages</li>
</ul></li>
<li>checked <a

on configuring custom domains for GitHub pages</li>
<li>configured a custom domain <a

</ul>
<h2 id="apache-with-https">Apache with HTTPS</h2>
<p>Same as Nginx, I can get SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt by doing
something like</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo certbot certonly --apache -d yourdomain.com  # I have not tested</code></pre>
<p>This command will perform some tests that check my control over the
domain and give me SSL certificate.</p>
<h2 id="decision-on-how-to-host-this-website">Decision on how to host
this website</h2>
<p>Using VPS + Nginx or Apache seemts to be a good and feasible choice
to host this website. However, since this website is a diary-like
content, I might be going to make changes such as adding a new entry
everyday. If I go with the VPS approach, everyday I need to ssh to the
server and pull the latest commits from remote (I don't want to ssh to
write something). With GitHub pages, I can just push commits and the
website reflects the changes automatically. I think it's the easiest
way.</p>
<p>Oh, and the reason I don't think about using physical servers is that
I'm sharing a house rn and cannot set up a static IP address. Also, I
need to buy and configure a mini PC or Raspberry Pi, but it takes time
and money to complete that.</p>
<p>Ngrok is easy to use but costs me around $30/month. I used to use it
and the experience with it is great, but it's a bit expensive for me,
compared to other options. Additionally, I need a physical PC same as
the static IP approach.</p>
<p>Let's proceed with GitHub pages.</p>
<h2 id="custom-domain-subdomain-configuration-for-github-pages">Custom
domain (subdomain) configuration for GitHub pages</h2>
<p>It was very easy to configure a custom subdomain for GitHub pages</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>GitHub Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Custom domain: Add the custom
domain you want to use to host the website</li>
<li>Your DNS service: Add CNAME your subdomain -&gt;
{your-user-id}.github.io</li>
<li>GitHub Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Custom domain: check if the DNS
setting is valid -&gt; if valid, youâ€™re all set</li>
</ol>
<p>This website is hosted on <a
