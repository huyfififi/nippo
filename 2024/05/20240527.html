<p>Finished implementing the first phase of the personal project, both
the backend and the frontend. -&gt; Deployed :tada: <a
href="https://dashboard.huyfififi.com">dashboard.huyfififi.com</a></p>
<p>There are many issues I resolved today to deploy, and I want to write
down them here but don't have tiem now. I will whenever possible.</p>
<h2 id="cloudflare-flexible-ssltls-encryption-modes">Cloudflare Flexible
SSL/TLS encryption modes</h2>
<p>I was thinking about obtaining SSL/TLS certificates from Let's
Encrypt by clearing its challenge, but as I tried to configure the VPS
(the server for the web application), I noticed that it's already
configured with SSL certificates. All I needed to do is simply serve the
application via HTTP; Cloudflare automatically enables HTTPS for end
users.</p>
<p>users &lt;-&gt; Cloudflare &lt;-&gt; my VPS</p>
<p>I have my domain in Cloudflare, and it turned out that it's
configured with <a
href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/flexible/">Flexible</a>
mode. The connections between my VPS and Cloudflare is not encrypted at
all, but the connections between users and Cloudflare are encrypted.
This encryption mode is called <strong>Flexible</strong>.</p>
<p>Although it's definitely not recommended, my application does not
contain any sensitive data, and I don't have enough time to do the right
configuration now, I decided to let that work for the time being.</p>
<p>It seems to be useful to have very small and personal projects on the
internet.</p>
<p>FYI: To make my subdomain dashboard.huyfififi.com points to the VPS,
A record was added dashboard.huyfififi.com -&gt; The static IP address
of the VPS to map them.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I cannot get static IP addresses at home
because I share a house and I will move soon. VPS (Virtual Private
Server) such as Amazon Lightsail provides a feature to attach a static
IP address, and it makes hosting personal projects possible at low
cost.</p>
<h2 id="frontend-deployment">Frontend Deployment</h2>
<p>This is the first time I serve frontend to production (?) and I
noticed that I did not understand how it works.</p>
<p>When developing features, node server is always run to serve the
frontend.</p>
<p>However, frontend servers won't be used in production. The static
files are generated from the build <code>npm run build</code> and the
server (such as NGINX) serve them. I don't need to start a separate
server for the frontend like I do in local development.</p>
<p>It's embarrassing that I was confused about that for a long time.</p>
