## NAS (Network Attached Storage)

[Seagate: What is NAS (Network Attached Storage and Why is NAS Important?)](https://www.seagate.com/blog/what-is-nas-master-ti/)

> Network-attached storage (NAS) devices store and share data for multiple computers, that can be accessed remotely.

[Set up file sharing on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-up-file-sharing-on-mac-mh17131/mac)

> You can share files and folders with others on your network. You can share your entire Mac with everyone or allow specific users access to only certain folders.

macOS natively comes with the NAS feature. By enabling System Settings -> Sharing -> File Sharing, files on the computer become accessible from other devices.
