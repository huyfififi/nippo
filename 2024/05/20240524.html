to check which version I should use in my GitHub Actions configuration
YAML. Updated v3 -&gt; v4 because there is no reason not to. The latest
does not introduce breaking changes, and it provides bug fixes and
additional features.</p>
<p>I suddenly began wondering what would happen if online documentation
was unavailable for organizational issues or other reasons. I used to
see people publish books about programming language manuals, but now,
for example, if servers are down, I cannot check the documentation.</p>
<p>In that case, I may be able to check the way back machine. I also bet
someone will host a website to serve the documents voluntarily. Maybe I
was worried too much.</p>

<p>It's embarassing that I have little knowledge on Kubernetes. I'm not
a DevOps engineer with my full-time position, and also other projects I
touched are better off sticking to simple architecture. (All my friends
at BigTech also don't understand how it works, so it's not that
embarrasing I don't know how to scale it, I hope?)</p>
<p>I hear that AWS and Azure have very different policy for server
outage; Azure provides more flexible compensation, but I don't know much
about it.</p>

Overflow: What’s the difference between Docker Compose and
Kubernetes?</a></p>
<p>Docker Compose deploys multi-container Docker apps to a single
server, while Kubernetes is a production-grade container orchestrator
that can run multiple container runtimes, including Docker's, across
multiple virtual or physical machines.</p>
<p>So they are very different.</p>
<p>I cannot use my compose.yaml</p>
<p><a href="kompose.io">Kompose</a> (The website looks neat)</p>

<p>An official Kubernetes project, located at
github.com/kubernetes/kompose</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GO FROM DOCKER COMPOSE TO KUBERNETES</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kompose is a conversion tool for Docker Compose to container
orchestrators such as Kubernetes (or OpenShift).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might want to use Kompose if I need to use configure Kubernetes
with a Compose file.</p>

Compose works | Docker Docs</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default path for a Compose file is compose.yaml (preferred) or
compose.yml that is placed in the working directory. Compose also
supports docker-compose.yaml and docker-compose.yml for backwards
compatibility of earlier versions. If both files exist, Compose prefers
the canonical compose.yaml.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Projects I've been involved use <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, so I
was surprised to know <code>compose.yaml</code> is the preferred name
here. I will use <code>compose.yaml</code> whenever possible from now
on.</p>
<p><a
href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/04-version-and-name/">Version
and name top-level elements</a></p>
<p>Also, I see that the top-level <code>version</code> property in a
Compose file is now obsolete while I can see that in several
projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The top-level version property is defined by the Compose
Specification for backward compatibility. It is only informative and
you’ll receive a warning message that it is obsolete if used. Compose
doesn’t use version to select an exact schema to validate the Compose
file, but prefers the most recent schema when it’s implemented.</p>
