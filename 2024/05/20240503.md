## SSL and TLS

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)

TLS (Transport Layer Security)

Both are protocols used for securing communication over a network, but TLS is the more modern and secure successor to SSL.

As TLS is mentioned in [Let\'s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

> A nonprofit Certificate Authority providing TLS certificates to 363 million websites.

TLS protocol and its certificates took over SSL in the real world. SSL is a commonly used term, but TLS is more accurate technically nowadays.

## [WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)](https://webrtc.org)

WebRTC is a set of technologies that allows web browsers and mobile applications to have real-time communication capabilities. Although modern web browsers have built-in support for the core WebRTC API, the raw WebRTC API can be complex and low-level. It\'s a common practice to use libraries or frameworks that simplify WebRTC development and provide additional features. 

> WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. The set of standards that comprise WebRTC makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install plug-ins or any other third-party software.

### Web Browser support

Chrome supports WebRTC natively [2](https://webrtc.github.io/webrtc-org/web-apis/chrome/)

> Both getUserMedia and RTCPeerConnection are implemented and shipping in Chrome for Windows, Linux, Mac and Android.

Firefox seems to support WebRTC, but the implementation seems to be different from Chrome\'s one, as I guessed by browsing web pages.

> For any questions or comments about Firefox\â€™s implementation of WebRTC, please go to [dev-media](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozilla.dev.media). For a discussion of WebRTC, please join us on the [discussion list](https://groups.google.com/group/discuss-webrtc).[3](https://webrtc.github.io/webrtc-org/web-apis/firefox/)

> Advancing WebRTC is a community of companies, individual contributors, web developers, and testers dedicated to growing and improving the WebRTC feature and making Firefox\'s implementation of WebRTC superb.[4](https://blog.mozilla.org/webrtc/)

### Libraries to use WebRTC

- [simple-peer](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer)

> Simple WebRTC video, voice, and data channels

- [adapter.js](https://github.com/webrtcHacks/adapter)

> adapter.js is a shim to insulate apps from spec changes and prefix differences in WebRTC.

TODO:

- Review the Codeforces problems I solved today, maybe on the weekend
- What is Node.js?
- Try to understand Duck Typing deeper (maybe next week)
	- In Python, Duck typing is used. When something implements the specific interface of duck, it\'s considered as a duck even though it can be a penguin or others. However, I cannot explain it in more details and concrete examples.
