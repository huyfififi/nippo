<blockquote>
<p>Node.js is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime
environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line
tools and scripts.<a href="https://nodejs.org/en">nodejs.org/en</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was talking with my friends, and had a doubt on the responsibility
of Node.js in the modern frontend development.</p>
<p>From my experience, projects with Vue.js or other frameworks usually
use Node.js, but the main feature of Node.js is creating API or other
server-side functionalities. When having backend servers, the backend
will provide API and take care of business logic, so the necessity of
Node.js looks doubtful to me.</p>
<p>Because I'm only familiar with Vue.js, I browsed some webpages on the
relationship between Vue.js &lt;-&gt; Node.js</p>

<p>It seems to be totally feasible to use Vue.js without Node.js; it can
be served from CDN[<a
href="https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start#using-vue-from-cdn">1</a>].</p>
<p>But, when thinking about running the application in my local machine,
Node.js is required[<a
href="https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start#creating-a-vue-application">2</a>].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prerequisites - Install Node.js version 18.3 or higher</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After mulling over, my tentative conclusion why we use Node.js is to
run the frontend application in local machines, which is necessary for
development.</p>
<p>Also, the dependency management feature of npm is needed for modern
web application development because modern web applications often rely
on multiple external libraries, and npm relies on Node.js to
function.</p>

<p>I have a friend who is not interested in technical details, but only
interested in creating something. Every time I talk with him, I feel
that he and I are on the same scale but in opposite positions. I wanted
to pursue Ph.D if I have enough money, mental stability, and and insame
to same extent.</p>
<p>I enjoyed creating something such as video games or silly mobile
applications, but with the full-time position, it's hard to output in
addition to input. My interest has changed, and now I try to understand
things as deeply as possible.</p>
