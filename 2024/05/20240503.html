<h2 id="ssl-and-tls">SSL and TLS</h2>
<p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)</p>
<p>TLS (Transport Layer Security)</p>
<p>Both are protocols used for securing communication over a network,
but TLS is the more modern and secure successor to SSL.</p>
<p>As TLS is mentioned in <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's
Encrypt</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A nonprofit Certificate Authority providing TLS certificates to 363
million websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TLS protocol and its certificates took over SSL in the real world.
SSL is a commonly used term, but TLS is more accurate technically
nowadays.</p>
<h2 id="webrtc-web-real-time-communication"><a
href="https://webrtc.org">WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)</a></h2>
<p>WebRTC is a set of technologies that allows web browsers and mobile
applications to have real-time communication capabilities. Although
modern web browsers have built-in support for the core WebRTC API, the
raw WebRTC API can be complex and low-level. It's a common practice to
use libraries or frameworks that simplify WebRTC development and provide
additional features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables Web
applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or
video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers
without requiring an intermediary. The set of standards that comprise
WebRTC makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing
peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install plug-ins or any
other third-party software. <a

<h3 id="web-browser-support">Web Browser support</h3>
<p>Chrome supports WebRTC natively <a
href="https://webrtc.github.io/webrtc-org/web-apis/chrome/">2</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both getUserMedia and RTCPeerConnection are implemented and shipping
in Chrome for Windows, Linux, Mac and Android.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firefox seems to support WebRTC, but the implementation seems to be
different from Chrome's one, as I guessed by browsing web pages.</p>
<blockquote>

WebRTC, please go to <a

<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the Codeforces problems I solved today, maybe on the
weekend</li>
<li>What is Node.js?</li>
<li>Try to understand Duck Typing deeper (maybe next week)
<ul>
<li>In Python, Duck typing is used. When something implements the
specific interface of duck, it's considered as a duck even though it can
be a penguin or others. However, I cannot explain it in more details and
concrete examples.</li>
