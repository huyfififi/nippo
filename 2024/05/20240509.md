「忍者と極道」が面白すぎて生活リズムが崩れた。I wonder if I can wake up early for tomorrow's Codeforces contest.

## [1972B. Coin Games](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1972/B)

[Editorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/129027)

I misunderstood the problem. I thought "flips the two coins that are adjacent to it" means

> FRF, R => coin to remove, F => coins to flip

but as the sapmle input shows, this is also possible

> RFF, FFR

and the approach is to count the number of U for each stage. It turns out that the parity of the coins switch for each operation.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var t int
	fmt.Scan(&t)

	for tc := 0; tc < t; tc++ {
		var n int
		fmt.Scan(&n)

		var s string
		fmt.Scan(&s)
		parity := 0
		for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
			if s[i] == 'U' {
				parity += 1
				parity %= 2
			}
		}
		if parity == 0 {
			fmt.Println("NO")
		} else {
			fmt.Println("YES")
		}
	}
}
```

TODO:

- Keep checking sample input in mind.
- Review this problem again.
