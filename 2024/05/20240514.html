<p>I was busy taking care of releases today.</p>
<p>Everyone is talking about GPT-4o. I usually use Google's Gemini and
GitHub Co-pilot, but it might be better to check GPT-4o out. I hear that
GPT-4o is not good at coding tho.</p>
<p>Wait, perhaps I don't have to be an early-adapter. Apple and OpenAI
are collaborating to develop AI assistant feature (?) (I suspect it is
similar to Siri), so I can wait for its release and start enjoying
talking with AI after its release. Let's stick to what I'm using for the
time being. I'm an old-fashioned guy who is only interested in
fundamentals instead of applications. I use zsh and vim.</p>
<h2 id="lets-encrypt-and-other-ssltls-certificates-providers">Let's
Encrypt and other SSL/TLS certificates providers</h2>
<p>Let's Encrypt provides free TLS certificates, and I was wondering
what the point is of buying certificates from other providers.</p>
<p>As I browsed a few web pages, I found information on that.o</p>
<h3 id="validity-duration">Validity Duration</h3>
<p>Let's Encrypt issues certificates valid for 90 days, whereas paid
certificates can last 1-3 years. Using paid certificates can reduce
renewal effot.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a> can automate
the renewal of TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt. I don’'t think the
longer validity of paid certicicates is the advantage.</p>
<p>On second thought, certbot's renewal can fail due to misconfiguration
(it happens in my VPS). Reducing the chances of failure is
beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="dv-vs-ov-ev">DV vs OV &amp; EV</h3>
<p>DV (Domain Validation): Lowest level. Certificate Authority (CA) only
verifies you control the domain, not your identity.</p>
<p>OV (Organization Validation): Mid-level. CA confirms your domain
ownership and validates your organization's legitimacy through
additional checks.</p>
<p>EV (Extended Validation): Highest level. EV involves the most
rigorous checks, verifying your organization's legal existence and good
standing.</p>
<p>Let's Encrypt checks if the domain is in control of the person who
requests a TLS certificate for it (DV), but it's a bare-minimum
standard.</p>
<p><a

<blockquote>
<p>What distinguishes OV &amp; EV certificates are the extra layers and
steps of validation required to obtain them. For both EV &amp; OV
certificates CAs must verify the domain owner as well as several details
related to the affiliated business including name, type, status, and
physical address.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When running business that deal with sensitive data, DV is not enough
to prove the identity to users.</p>
<p>This is my certificate of ocalaavenue.net</p>
<pre><code>Issued to:
Common Name (CN)    ocalaavenue.net
Organization (O)    &lt;Not Part Of Certificate&gt;
Organizational Unit (OU)    &lt;Not Part Of Certificate&gt;

Issued by:
Common Name (CN)    R3
Organization (O)    Let&#39;s Encrypt
Organizational Unit (OU)    &lt;Not Part Of Certificate&gt;</code></pre>
<p>and this is facebook's</p>
<pre><code>Issued to:
Common Name (CN)    *.facebook.com
Organization (O)    Meta Platforms, Inc.
Organizational Unit (OU)    &lt;Not Part Of Certificate&gt;

Issued by:
Common Name (CN)    DigiCert SHA2 High Assurance Server CA
Organization (O)    DigiCert Inc
Organizational Unit (OU)    www.digicert.com</code></pre>
<p>You can see the organization name is provided in the facebook's, but
not in mine from Let's Encrypt. Facebook's is with at least OV in
addition to DV.</p>
<p>Now I'm getting why companies don't use Let's Encrypt. (I see some
companies I've been involved use Let's Encrypt tho :sweat:)</p>
<h3 id="other-benefits-of-paid-certificates">Other benefits of paid
certificates</h3>
<p>Here are some examples</p>
<h4 id="customer-support">Customer Support</h4>
<p>Paid certificate vendors often offer customer support to help with
installation, troubleshooting, and other certificate-related issues
whereas Let's Encrypt is a self-service platform.</p>
<h4 id="warranty">Warranty</h4>
<p>For example, DigiCert's Secure Site certificate provides warranty[<a
href="https://docs.digicert.com/en/certcentral/manage-certificates/secure-site-certificate-benefits.html">1</a>].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Industry-leading warranties. Secure Site certificates include
warranties to protect you and your customers: a $1.75M Netsure
Protection Warranty for your business and an industry-best $2M aggregate
Relying Party Warranty for your customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see many other advantages of paid TLS certificates.</p>
