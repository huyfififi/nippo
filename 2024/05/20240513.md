## [1971C. Clock and Strings](https://codeforces.com/contest/1971/problem/C)

[My idea](20240512.html) was that there should be an intersection when c and d belong to different sides split by a and b.

The approach mentioned in [Editorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/129364) is to walk around the clock from 1 to 12. If two red strings or two blue strings appear in a row, there is no intersection.

Here is my implementation of that approach. The editorial shows a more concise way, but for now, I\'ll put it to follow my natural thought process.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func intersect(a int, b int, c int, d int) bool {
	before := 0
	for i := 0; i < 12; i++ {
		if i == a {
			if before == b {
				return false
			}
			before = a
		} else if i == b {
			if before == a {
				return false
			}
			before = b
		} else if i == c {
			if before == d {
				return false
			}
			before = c
		} else if i == d {
			if before == c {
				return false
			}
			before = d
		}
	}
	return true
}

func main() {
	var t int
	fmt.Scan(&t)

	var a, b, c, d int
	for i := 0; i < t; i++ {
		fmt.Scan(&a, &b, &c, &d)
		if intersect(a, b, c, d) {
			fmt.Println("YES")
		} else {
			fmt.Println("NO")
		}
	}
}
```

> For each query, we binary search to find the last sign we passed (since the array a is sorted).

I understand binary search, but I could not come up with using it during the contest.

Let\'s try to implement this approach tomorrow.

## DOM (Document Object Model)

From [Introduction to the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

> The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.

The DOM represents the web page content and structure as a tree, and each element in the HTML document is treated as a node in the tree.

As I look at the [web page of University of Wachinton](https://staff.washington.edu/weller/css/DOM1.html), the tree structure might look like 

```
document
└── html
    ├── body
    │   ├── h1
    │   │   └── This is a heading
    │   └── p
    │       ├── This is
    │       ├── a
    │       └── b
    │           └── body
    └── head
        └── title
            └── this is a title
```

JavaScript can access and manipulate the DOM tree. This allows us to dynamically change the content, style, and behavior of a web page.

Benefits of DOM

- Provides a standardized way to access and manipulate web page content across different browsers.
- Enables creation of dynamic and interactive web pages.
