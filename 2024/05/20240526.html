<p>Finished implementing the API that I needed in this phase. Moved on
to the frontend development.</p>
<p>Browsed MUI (<a href="mui.com">mui.com</a>), which my friend
recommended.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MUI offers a comprehensive suite of free UI tools to help you ship
new features faster. Start with Material UI, our fully-loaded component
library, or bring your own design system to our production-ready
components.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Material UI is an open-source React component library that implements
Googleâ€™s Material Design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, MUI seems to provide ready-to-use React components, and I don't
have to worry about CSS with this.</p>
<p>For my use case, <a
href="https://mui.com/material-ui/react-card/">Card</a> seems to suit.
It can be used to display a single content. Also <a
href="https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/typography/">Typography</a>
is easy to use as it comes with default CSS, and I use it in the card
components.</p>
