- Added celery in my personal project
- Tried to write a Github Actions configuration file for a gigantic Django project, but failed to resolve issues. Tired.
	- print() in migration files are in stdout, so the preparation of test database should be working fine, but facing errors when running tests after the mgiration
	- database configuration in settings.py looks very fine to me

```

## Git Aliases to switch user profile

I added these aliases in `~/.gitconfig` to switch user profiles for work and personal time

```
[alias]
	suffer = !git config --global user.email 'work@email.com'
	bail-out = !git config --global user.email 'personal@email.com'
```

Now I can easily switch user profiles. I\'ve been involvd in multiple projects/repositories, and found it difficult to manage user configurations.

## Enabling HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

Enabling HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for my web application involves configuring the web server that serves the application.

### Enabling HTTP/2 with Nginx

#### 1. Update Nginx to 1.9.5 or later

In my case, my Nginx container should be able to serve with HTTP/2

[https://github.com/huyfififi/mastodon/blob/main/docker-compose.yml#L136](https://github.com/huyfififi/mastodon/blob/main/docker-compose.yml#L136)

```docker-compose.yml
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.25.3
```

#### 2. Update the configuration for port 443 (HTTPS)

HTTP/2 seems to require TLS (encryption for HTTP connections)

- [Stack OverFlow: Why do browser implementations of HTTP/2 require TLS?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34076231/why-do-browser-implementations-of-http-2-require-tls)
- [Stack Overflow: Is TLS mandatory for HTTP/2?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61051169/is-tls-mandatory-for-http-2)

Therefore, it will go under port 443

It seems I already turned on HTTP/2

[https://github.com/huyfififi/mastodon/blob/main/dist/nginx.conf](https://github.com/huyfififi/mastodon/blob/main/dist/nginx.conf) <- It's completely messy. I better review and update it.

```nginx.conf
  server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    http2 on;
    server_name ocalaavenue.net;
```

but it seems this also works

```nginx.conf
  server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
```

#### 3. Restart the server and check the protocol used in response

```zsh
# curl -I --http2 https://ocalaavenue.net
HTTP/2 200
```

I can see that HTTP/2 is in response headers, meaning that my Mastodon instance is already served with HTTP/2

### Enabling HTTP/3 with Nginx

[nginx: Support for QUIC and HTTP/3](https://nginx.org/en/docs/quic.html)

It seems I better check QUIC before trying to digest the configuration. It looks intimidating.
