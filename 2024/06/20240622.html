<p>I can really sympathize with this. I don’t want to share a room or
tent at a hotel, even with my close friends.</p>

<h2 id="ssh-and-git-repositories-githubbitbucket">SSH and Git
repositories (GitHub/BitBucket)</h2>
<p>I thought SSH is only used to send shell commands to remote computers
securely because of the name “Secure Shell,” but it can be generally
used for secure authentication and communication.</p>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4253">RFC 4253 -
The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and
other secure network services over an insecure network.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This document describes the SSH transport layer protocol, which
typically runs on top of TCP/IP. The protocol can be used as a basis for
a number of secure network services. It provides strong encryption,
server authentication, and integrity protection. It may also provide
compression.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Key exchange method, public key algorithm, symmetric encryption
algorithm, message authentication algorithm, and hash algorithm are all
negotiated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This document also describes the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method
and the minimal set of algorithms that are needed to implement the SSH
transport layer protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When used to communicate with Git repositories,</p>
<p>Authentication: Instead of using passwords, SSH uses cryptographic
keys for authentication. I generate a pair of keys (private and public)
and the public key is uploaded to the Git hosting service whereas my
private key stays in my local. When interacting with remote
repositories, the SSH protocol is used to verify my identity securely
without sending my private key over the network.</p>
<p>Data Transmission: All data transmitted between my machine and Git
repositories will be encrypted with the protocol, ensuring that my code
will be transferred securely.</p>
<h3 id="diffie-hellman-key-exchange">Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</h3>
<p>Diffie-Hellman algorithm is used to share the same secret between two
parties (In my case, my computer and the GitHub server). After sharing
the same secret, that can be used to communicate data.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Asymmetric key exchange (the operation is expensive, so will be done
only once)</li>
<li>data transmission with a symmetric cryptography</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Diffie_Hellman">Diffie
Hellman - OpenSSLWiki</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In static-static mode both Alice and Bob retain their private/public
keys over multiple communications. Therefore the resulting shared secret
will be the same every time. In ephemeral-static mode one party will
generate a new private/public key every time, thus a new shared secret
will be generated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a number of standards relevant to Diffie-Hellman key
agreement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems there are variants of the algorithms.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hswtjs/does_modern_ssh_always_use_ephemeral_session_keys/">Reddit:
Does modern SSH always use ephemeral session keys after
authentication?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>IIRC, yes it’s always ephemeral. SSH does it’s “KEX” thing to
generate a new symmetric key per connection and employs a re-key
interval to provide forward security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I googled a little bit, but this is the only web page referring
static vs ephemeral.</p>
<p>I suspect that the SSH communications with GitHub (and other
platforms) does not reuse the same secret for a symmetric cryptography
due to security concern (ephemeral-static mode), but I'm not confident
as I couldn’t find resources of that at the moment.</p>

<p>I'm still not confident with tackling problems with difficulty 800 no
matter how many problems I solved. No matter how many problems I solved,
I’m still not confident about tackling problems with difficulty 800.
Maybe more experience can give me the confidence and courage to move on
to more difficult problems.</p>
<p>I want to update the dashboard with a breakdown (like, showing the
number of problems with difficulty 800 I solved), but I've been quite
busy these days.. will consider adding the feature in the next long day
offs.</p>
