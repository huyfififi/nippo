<p>Is <code>detectron2</code> still a valid option for object
detections? I can see that itnot actively maintained since 2021 and has
many configuration issues. Better use YOLOv5 or others? Pls guide me on
that if you are familiar with that.</p>
<p>My apptetite is never satisfied.</p>
<p>I had an eel onigiri but that was not very good.</p>
<p>It was a long day, but I will have some time tomorrow. I might be
able to tackle some Codeforces problems and do some research,
hopefully.</p>
<p>Checked subscriptions -&gt; it seems I successfully cancelled the
subscriptions, but better keep an eye on them.</p>
