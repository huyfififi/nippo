<p>Worked a bit on the system design of a new micro service.</p>
<p>New month, new me.</p>
<p>I didn't have an environment to work on competitive programming and
others when I was a student, and though it's embarrassing, I sometimes
feel jealous of people who could have done this thing in their early
days.</p>
<p>Anyway, I better keep going.</p>

<p>Tabulation</p>
<pre><code>def min_removal(s: str) -&gt; int:
    dp = [0] * (
        n + 1
    )  # dp[i] will hold the minimum deletions needed to make s[:i] beautiful
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        if s[i - 3 : i] in (&quot;pie&quot;, &quot;map&quot;):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 3] + 1
        else:
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1]  # same as s[:i-1] because s[i] does not increase the number of removals
    return dp[n]

    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(min_removal(s))</code></pre>
<p>I can't fully explain how to replicate this solution. I'll come back
later.</p>
<p>The only thing I'm sure is that, dynamic programming is all about
finding recurrence relations.</p>

<p>Memoization is intuitive for my brain, but it seems not to be
practical, at least in the competitive programming context.</p>
<p>TODO: Consider the tabulation approach</p>
<p>Also, I should remember that the total number of iterations should be
below 10 ** 10, perhaps?</p>
<p>20240602: On second thought, the memo is reused for each test case,
and the total number of (a, b, c) combinations is 10 ** 6, which should
be independent of the total number of test cases 10 ** 5.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;
(a, b, c) =&gt; 100 * 100 * 100 = 10 ** 6
num of testcases =&gt; 10 ** 5

10 ** 11 &gt; 10 ** 10 TLE
