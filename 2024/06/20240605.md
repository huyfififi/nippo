# 20240605

- Fixed several issues in my personal project.
	- There are many issues... I wish I had 48 hours a day or infinite motivation
- Signed up for paperless renewal notice
- Requested change of address
	- I don\'t get any notificaions on that. I might want to check if it goes properly later.

My circadian rhythm is broken. I couldn\'t study after the work. I might want to take day offs as I don\'t take many PTO this year yet.
