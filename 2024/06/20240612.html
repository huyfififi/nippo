<p>Today was not very busy, but could be every productive. I used to
have a weekly study group. Maybe I should create another, but the
problem is that I don't have many friends interested in what I'm
interested in.</p>
<p>The next Codeforces Round starts at 2:15 am PST !? There's no way I
can join.</p>
<p>Skyrim is too interesting… It feels like I live another life.</p>
<h2 id="aws-efs-elastic-file-system">AWS EFS (Elastic File System)</h2>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/">AWS: Shared File Storage -
Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)</a></p>
<p>I don't get time to look into all the details, but here is my current
understanding.</p>
<p>Amazon EFS is a file storage that auto-scale and can be shared across
AWS infrastructures such as EC2 instances, AWS containers, and Lambda
functions. On-premises servers can access the file storage with Amazon
Direct Connect, too.</p>
<p>The only thing to do to use the file system is mounting the file
system on AWS infrastructures like EC2 instances. Then, files can be
accessed as if they are on the computers.</p>

<pre><code>$ man traceroute

NAME
     traceroute – print the route packets take to network host

DESCRIPTION
     The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware, connected together by gateways.  Tracking the route one&#39;s packets follow (or finding the miscreant gateway that&#39;s discarding your
     packets) can be difficult.  traceroute utilizes the IP protocol `time to live&#39; field and attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along the path to some host.

     The only mandatory parameter is the destination host name or IP number.  The default probe datagram length is 40 bytes, but this may be increased by specifying a packet size (in bytes) after the
     destination host name.</code></pre>
<p>tried in my local machine, but the ICMP packets are only responded up
to the 11th packet.</p>

Fault: what does “***” mean when traceroute</a></p>
<p>I tried some options such as -P to specify IP protocol or -m to
specify the max time-to-live, but could not make it past the 11th hop.
Maybe something happens at the 12th router, and it does not send ICMP
packets back?</p>
