Is `detectron2` still a valid option for object detections? I can see that it\s not actively maintained since 2021 and has many configuration issues. Better use YOLOv5 or others? Pls guide me on that if you are familiar with that.

My apptetite is never satisfied.

I had an eel onigiri but that was not very good.

It was a long day, but I will have some time tomorrow. I might be able to tackle some Codeforces problems and do some research, hopefully.

Checked subscriptions -> it seems I successfully cancelled the subscriptions, but better keep an eye on them.
