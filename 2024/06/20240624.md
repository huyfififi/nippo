- Updated the TLS certificate of the Mastodon instance
- Updated my resume with the experience of fixing N+1 problems.

## [1941A. Rudolf and the Ticket](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1941/A)

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    for bi in b:
        for ci in c:
            if bi + ci <= k:
                res += 1
    print(res)
```

## [1986A. X Axis](https://codeforces.com/contest/1986/problem/A)

I first explored mathematical approaches, but as I looked at the constraint, I noticed I could just use brute force.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x1, x2, x3 = map(int, input().split())
    mi = 30
    for i in range(1, 11):
        mi = min(mi, abs(x1 - i) + abs(x2 - i) + abs(x3 - i))
    print(mi)
```

However, there is a clever way as [Codeforces Round 954 (Div. 3) Editorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/130762) points out

> Let x1 <= x2 <= x3. Notice that the answer is at least x3 - x1, because |x3 - a| + |x1 - a| >= |x3 - x1| for any numbers a, x1, x3.

> The answer is equal to x3 - x1, since we can choose a = x2.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x1, x2, x3 = map(int, input().split())
    ma = max(x1, max(x2, x3))
    mi = min(x1, min(x2, x3))
    print(ma - mi)
```

It sounds like a common technique, and I better keep that in mind.

## [1937A. Shuffle Party](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1937/A)

[Codeforces Round 930 Editorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/126513)

couldn\'t understand it today. will try to digest later.

```
# i=_: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# i=2: [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# i=3: [3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# i=4: [3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# i=5: [5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8]
# i=6: [5, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, 8]
# i=7: [7, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2, 5, 8]

# observation: largest power of 2 up to n


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    res = 1
    while True:
        if res * 2 > n:
            print(res)
            break
        res *= 2
```
