Worked a bit on the system design of a new micro service.

## [1941C. Rudolf and the Ugly String](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1941/C)

Tabulation

```
def min_removal(s: str) -> int:
    dp = [0] * (
        n + 1
    )  # dp[i] will hold the minimum deletions needed to make s[:i] beautiful
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        if s[i - 3 : i] in ("pie", "map"):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 3] + 1
        else:
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1]  # same as s[:i-1] because s[i] does not increase the number of removals
    return dp[n]


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(min_removal(s))
```

I can\'t fully explain how to replicate this solution. I\'ll come back later.

The only thing I\'m sure is that, dynamic programming is all about finding recurrence relations.

As I get older, it's getting harder to stop eating, or maybe I\'m just stressted out.
