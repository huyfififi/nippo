<p>Spent time with my wife, drawing pictures of Jujutsu Kaisen together.
I'm glad that there are hobbies we can share.</p>
<p>I've been (sort of) busy these days and could tackle problems with
difficulty 800, but I better check problems with difficulty 900.</p>
<h2 id="b.-nene-and-the-card-game"><a
href="https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1956/B">1956B. Nene and
the Card Game</a></h2>
<p>Let's say, both players have exactly one card for each number
1..n</p>
<p>To create a pair, i.e, one player has two cards with the same number,
one card from the first player and one card from the second player must
be swapped, resulting in both players have one pair of the same
number.</p>
<p>=&gt; The numner of pairs I will have and the number of pairs Nene
will have are the same.</p>
<p>Let's consider the remaining parts; I only have different numbers in
hand.</p>
<p>My turn always goes first, and Nene always minimizes my score. How
does she do? by avoiding selecting a number that is not public.
&lt;=&gt; Nene will minimize my score by selecting the number I place
right after my turn.</p>
<p>Then, I only get score from the same number pairs in my hand.</p>
