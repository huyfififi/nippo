<h2 id="awk">AWK</h2>
<p><a
href="https://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/gawk_3.html#SEC10">math.utah.edu:
AWK Language Programming - Getting Started with awk</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic function of awk is to search files for lines (or other
units of text) that contain certain patterns. When a line matches one of
the patterns, awk performs specified actions on that line. awk keeps
processing input lines in this way until the end of the input files are
reached.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Programs in awk are different from programs in most other languages,
because awk programs are data-driven; that is, you describe the data you
wish to work with, and then what to do when you find it. Most other
languages are procedural; you have to describe, in great detail, every
step the program is to take. When working with procedural languages, it
is usually much harder to clearly describe the data your program will
process. For this reason, awk programs are often refreshingly easy to
both write and read.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you run awk, you specify an awk program that tells awk what to
do. The program consists of a series of rules… Each rule specifies one
pattern to search for, and one action to perform when that pattern is
found.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Syntactically, a rule consists of a pattern followed by an action.
The action is enclosed in curly braces to separate it from the pattern.
Rules are usually separated by newlines. Therefore, an awk program looks
like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>pattern { action }
pattern { action }
...</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>There are several ways to run an awk program. If the program is
short, it is easiest to include it in the command that runs awk, like
this:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>awk &#39;program&#39; input-file1 input-file2 ...</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>where program consists of a series of patterns and actions, as
described earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the program is long, it is usually more convenient to put it in
a file and run it with a command like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>awk -f program-file input-file1 input-file2 ...</code></pre>
<p><a
href="https://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/gawk_22.html#GLOSS52">math.utah.edu:
AWK Language Programming - Glossary</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pattern: Patterns tell awk which input records are interesting to
which rules. A pattern is an arbitrary conditional expression against
which input is tested. If the condition is satisfied, the pattern is
said to match the input record. A typical pattern might compare the
input record against a regular expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Action: A series of awk statements attached to a rule. If the rule’s
pattern matches an input record, awk executes the rule’s action. Actions
are always enclosed in curly braces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK now it's time to write my first <code>awk</code> program. I have
this Python file <code>c.py</code> created yesterday.</p>
<pre><code>def convert_time(s: str) -&gt; str:
    hh, mm = s.split(&quot;:&quot;)
    if hh == &quot;00&quot;:
        return f&quot;12:{mm} AM&quot;
    elif hh == &quot;12&quot;:
        return f&quot;12:{mm} PM&quot;
    elif 0 &lt; int(hh) &lt; 12:
        return f&quot;{hh}:{mm} AM&quot;
    else:  # 12 &lt; int(hh) &lt; 24
        return f&quot;{str((int(hh) - 12)).zfill(2)}:{mm} PM&quot;


for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    print(convert_time(s))</code></pre>
<p>An AWK program <code>'/return/ {print}'</code> prints all the return
statements in the file.</p>
<pre><code>$ awk &#39;/return/ {print}&#39; c.py
        return f&quot;12:{mm} AM&quot;
        return f&quot;12:{mm} PM&quot;
        return f&quot;{hh}:{mm} AM&quot;
        return f&quot;{str((int(hh) - 12)).zfill(2)}:{mm} PM&quot;</code></pre>
<p>As I browsed <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Concatenation.html">gnu.org:
Concatenation (The GNU Awk User’s Guide)</a>, it's possible to tweak the
output.</p>
<pre><code>$ awk &#39;/return/ {print &quot;found return statement: &quot; $0}&#39; c.py
found return statement:         return f&quot;12:{mm} AM&quot;
found return statement:         return f&quot;12:{mm} PM&quot;
found return statement:         return f&quot;{hh}:{mm} AM&quot;
found return statement:         return f&quot;{str((int(hh) - 12)).zfill(2)}:{mm} PM&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Printing only the return values</p>
<pre><code>$ awk &#39;/return/ {print $2}&#39; c.py
f&quot;12:{mm}
f&quot;12:{mm}
f&quot;{hh}:{mm}
f&quot;{str((int(hh)</code></pre>
<p>Now, I have very basic knowledge of <code>awk</code>. Though Python
scripts might be more straightforward solutions in most cases,
performing simple actions with minimal setup is cool, might be useful
when troubleshooting servers.</p>
