<p>All DNS servers fall into one of four categories: Recursive
resolvers, root nameservers, TLD nameservers, and authoritative
nameservers.</p>

Recursive resolver (also known as recursive DNS resolver or recursive
DNS server)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/dns-server">[2] IBM: What Is a
DNS server?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>…this is the first stop for a recursive query—the process of one DNS
server communicating with other DNS servers to locate and return an IP
address.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This server receives a DNS query and can connect a user to the
desired site using cached data, or if site data is not cached, send a
follow-up request to DNS name servers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most DNS recursors are provided by internet service providers
(ISP).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/blog/isp-meaning">[3] Verizon:
What is an Internet Service Provider (ISP)?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An internet service provider (ISP) is a company that provides access
to the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="dns-root-name-server">DNS root name server</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When a recursive DNS server does not have cached data, it sends a DNS
query to the DNS root name server. The root name server accepts the
query and forwards it to a top level domain (TLD) name server[2].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which TLD server the query is forwarded to depends on the desired
sites extension: .com, .org or .net, for example. There are 13 main DNS
root servers operated by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers (ICANN)[2].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The 13 DNS root nameservers are known to every recursive resolver,
and they are the first stop in a recursive resolver’s quest for DNS
records. A root server accepts a recursive resolver’s query which
includes a domain name, and the root nameserver responds by directing
the recursive resolver to a TLD nameserver, based on the extension of
that domain (.com, .net, .org, etc.). The root nameservers are overseen
by a nonprofit called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers (ICANN)[1].</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="top-level-domain-tld-name-server">Top level domain (TLD) name
server</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>TLD name servers contain data related to domain names with the same
extension. This means there are designated TLD servers for websites with
the extensions .com, .org and .net. Once the query reaches the correct
TLD name server, it is then directed to the authoritative name
server[2].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Management of TLD nameservers is handled by the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA), which is a branch of ICANN. The IANA breaks up
the TLD servers into two main groups:[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Generic top-level domains: These are domains that are not country
specific, some of the best-known generic TLDs include .com, .org, .net,
.edu, and .gov.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Country code top-level domains: These include any domains that are
specific to a country or state. Examples include .uk, .us, .ru, and
.jp.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="authoritative-name-server">Authoritative name server</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Generally the final step in the process of retrieving an IP address,
authoritative DNS servers store information related to specific domain
names in DNS resource records. These DNS records contain information
about a specific domain and its corresponding IP address. When the
correct IP address is found, it is sent back to the recursive resolver.
If it is not located, the user will receive an error message[2].</p>

What Is Authoritative DNS server?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The authoritative DNS servers can be where the website is hosted or
where the DNS provider is.</p>

<p>I use Cloudflare to manage DNS records of my domain. Here, Cloudflare
serves as the authoritative DNS server for my domain.</p>
