I wasn\'t expecting today would be this busy day.

- updated a bullet point in my resume. will continue to work on that
 
It\'s super helpful that Django\'s extensions come with admin sites. API keys can be revoked on UI. Cron schedule can be adjusted on UI.

I didn\'t have much time to do things in the TODO list. I have some appointments tomorrow, but I hope I can continue to make process.

## [1946A. Median of an Array](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1946/A)

It took me 3 hours to understand and solve this problem...

Coming up with an algorithm that counts the number of elements to be increased was difficult.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    mid_i = n // 2 - 1 if n % 2 == 0 else n // 2
    mid = a[mid_i]
    mid_count = len([ai for ai in a if ai == mid])
    keep_count = 0
    for i in range(mid_i):
        if a[i] == mid:
            keep_count += 1
    print(mid_count - keep_count)
```
