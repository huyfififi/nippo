<h2 id="personalities">16 Personalities</h2>
<p>Checked <a
href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16Personalities</a> with my
wife. This time, my personalities turned out to be INFJ (Advocate) and
my wife's is ISFJ. Only the second is different (N, Intuition vs S,
Sensing), so it may be said that we are very similiar, but my peronality
always change depending on life stages. I believe both logical thinking
and emotional feeling are very important, and it does not make sense to
bring logic into everyday life, such as dietary pereferences. I had a
frined from college, and he thought everything should be judged by
logic. To be honest, I found a bit difficult to spent my personal time
with him because he always try to bring logic to my emotional judgement.
I didn't say to him at that time, but he did not exercise regularly or
pay attention to his health. It's a known fact that exercising can help
in many ways for a long term, but he did not do that. I find his
attitude is contradictory.</p>
<p>As a human, it's not possible to work like a machine. It's important
to consider things logically, but it's also important to respect the
hormone balance and feelings.</p>
<p>I digress, but what I wanted to say is, I weight emotion and logic
equally, and personality tests such as 16 personalities cannot get the
nuance of mine. Also, I have experienced a lot in life. I am always out
of my comfort zone. Therefore, my peronality constantly changes.</p>
<p>I was surprised that all my friends don't feel that way. Their
personalities tests results are fixed from their young ages.</p>
<p>Maybe that is because my upbringing was very unique.</p>
