an Array</a></h2>
<p>It took me 3 hours to understand and solve this problemâ€¦</p>
<p>Coming up with an algorithm that counts the number of elements to be
increased was difficult.</p>
<pre><code>for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    mid_i = n // 2 - 1 if n % 2 == 0 else n // 2
    mid = a[mid_i]
    mid_count = len([ai for ai in a if ai == mid])
    keep_count = 0
    for i in range(mid_i):
        if a[i] == mid:
            keep_count += 1
    print(mid_count - keep_count)</code></pre>
