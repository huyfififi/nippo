<p>I forgot I would have an MTG, which conflicts with the Codeforces
contest tomorrow. I reluctantly withdrew from the contest.</p>
<p>My address was successfully updated, but it seems I need to wait for
some time to renew my DL/ID.</p>
<p>Checked GitHub payment information.</p>

<p>Ordered shoes. I will run 6+km with my friends next Friday, so I'm
preparing for that, running regularly and trying to reduce weight.</p>
<p>I always work too hard on Monday as I recover energy during the
weekend. I better find the pace not to burn out easily.</p>
<h2 id="netlify">Netlify</h2>
<p>Netlify is a powerful platform for deploying and managing modern web
projects.</p>
<p>Netlify provides various features for deploying and managing modern
web projects, but here are the features I might want to use for personal
projects.</p>
<h3 id="redirects-and-rewrites-to-return-410-gone"><a
href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/"><code>Redirects and rewrites</code>
to return 410 Gone</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You can configure redirect and rewrite rules for your Netlify
site…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When configuring <code>410 Gone</code> for my website…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>create a Netlify application</li>
<li>create a plain text file <code>_redirects</code> with
<code>/* /410.html 410!</code></li>
<li>push changes to the Git repository to trigger the build</li>
</ol>
<p>It redirects all traffic to 410.html, so that I can let users know
the service is gone.</p>
<p>However, I already have a VPS running the Mastodon instance with
Nginx as a reverse proxy. Why not update the Nginx configuration
directly to return <code>410 Gone</code>?</p>
<p>I won't close the instance anytime soon, but better do more research
later.</p>

Step-by-Step Guide: Deploying A Static Site or Single-page App</a></p>
<p>This blog guides us through the configuration and looks very easy to
follow.</p>
<p>I'm tired of writing Nginx configuration or managing TLS
certificates, so maybe I should use Netlify for the next project (if
any).</p>

Divisible by 25</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/96034">Editorial for
Codeforces Round #748 (Div.3)</a></p>
<p>It seems the optimal solution is not different from mine; the only
difference is the solution extracts the common operations.</p>
<h2 id="b.-mocha-and-red-and-blue"><a

Red and Blue</a></h2>
<p>I think we can do a greedy solution.</p>
<p><code>?</code> -&gt; skip <code>R</code> -&gt; (<code>BR</code> or
<code>RB</code>) * n (n &gt;= 0) + <code>B</code> <code>B</code> -&gt;
(<code>BR</code> or <code>RB</code>) * n (n &gt;= 0) +
<code>R</code></p>
<p>It works on paper, but I could not make it work as the conditions are
complex (for me). I'll check its editorial tomorrow.</p>
