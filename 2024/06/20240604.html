<p>worked hard and made many decisions today. I'm sleepy… but better
post this entry before going to bed.</p>
<h2 id="pricing-of-datadog">Pricing of DataDog</h2>
<p>I was asked to add as many logs as possible to make it easier to
troubleshoot, but I wondered if it would cost a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A log is a text-based record of activity generated by an operating
system, an application, or by other sources. Datadog charges for
ingested logs based on the total number of gigabytes submitted to the
Datadog Logs service. A log event is a log that is indexed by the
Datadog Logs service. Datadog charges per million log events submitted
for indexing at the rate designated for the retention policy you
selected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ingest: STARTING AT $0.10 Per ingested or scanned GB, per month</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: I should add only meaningful logs to reduce the cost.</p>
<h2 id="billing-for-github-actions">Billing for GitHub Actions</h2>
<p><a

About billing for GitHub Actions</a></p>
<p>It seems there are too many conditions to understand before falling
asleep, but</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For private repositories, each GitHub account receives a certain
amount of free minutes and storage for use with GitHub-hosted runners,
depending on the account’s plan. Any usage beyond the included amounts
is controlled by spending limits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Plan: GitHub Team, Storage: 2GB, Minutes (per month): 3000</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your account's usage surpasses these limits and you have set a
spending limit above $0 USD, you will pay $0.008 USD per GB of storage
per day and per-minute usage depending on the operating system used by
the GitHub-hosted runner. GitHub rounds the minutes and partial minutes
each job uses up to the nearest whole minute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I can run GitHub Actions</p>
<pre><code>3000 minutes per month ~= 1000 minutes per day ~= 16.7 hours per day across all repositories</code></pre>
<p>without extra fees. It seems we don't reach the limit for the time
being.</p>
<p>If our organization becomes bigger, I might want to think about
making each CI tests on PR small and running complete tests periodically
(infrequently).</p>
<h2 id="google-testing-blog">Google Testing Blog</h2>
<p>I just got to know the blog <a
href="https://testing.googleblog.com/">testing.googleblog.com</a>. They
seem to be very insightful. Maybe I better check that out
constantly.</p>
