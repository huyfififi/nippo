## React and TypeScript

It\'s said that the conbination of React and TypeScript a popular way to build large-scale application. Although I\'m getting familiar with Vue.js, it might be better to start exploring the frameworks as I sense that I might be in projects using them.

## [266A. Stones on the Table](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/266/A)

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var n int
	fmt.Scan(&n)

	// stones are colored with 3 colors
	// > Count the minimum number of stones to take from the table
	// > so that any two neighboring stones had different colors.
	// to make any neighboring stones have different colors,
	// consecutive stones with the same colors need to be removed.
	// <=> Count the number of stones with the same color as the next stone.
	var stones string
	fmt.Scan(&stones)

	counter := 0
	for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ {
		if stones[i] == stones[i+1] {
			counter += 1
		}
	}
	fmt.Println(counter)
}
```
