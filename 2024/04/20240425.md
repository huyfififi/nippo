I just started working on the frontend side and am still not familiar with frameworks, but I find Vue.js easy to use. Creating small parts (components) and using them to compose UI just makes sense. Also, the structure of a component is easy to understand; it has HTML-based template, data, methods, computed, and others. Even I, a backend engineer, could start writing code immediately.

As my friend says, one of the main challenges in frontend development seems to be CSS, not writing functions or that sort of things. I know the basic syntax but I have no idea how they learned to make the web page layout work as expected.

## difference between == and === in JavaScript

[Difference Between == and === in Javascript](https://www.scaler.com/topics/javascript/difference-between-double-equals-and-triple-equals-in-javascript/#)

> The main difference between the == and === operator in javascript is that the == operator does the type conversion of the operands before comparison, whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands.

```
1 == "1"  // true (number 1 converted to string "1")
0 == false // true (false converted to number 0)
null == undefined // true (both are "falsy" values)
```

```
1 === "1"  // false (different types)
0 === false // false (different types)
null === undefined // false (different types)
```

I was super busy today fixing a bunch of bugs. I hope I\'ll have time to learn new things tmr.

TODO:

- One problem from codeforces to get familiar with Go
- Check if I can reuse the CSS I used five years ago to format this Nippo
