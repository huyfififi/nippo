<p>I just started working on the frontend side and am still not familiar
with frameworks, but I find Vue.js easy to use. Creating small parts
(components) and using them to compose UI just makes sense. Also, the
structure of a component is easy to understand; it has HTML-based
template, data, methods, computed, and others. Even I, a backend
engineer, could start writing code immediately.</p>
<p>As my friend says, one of the main challenges in frontend development
seems to be CSS, not writing functions or that sort of things. I know
the basic syntax but I have no idea how they learned to make the web
page layout work as expected.</p>

Between == and === in Javascript</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main difference between the == and === operator in javascript is
that the == operator does the type conversion of the operands before
comparison, whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the
data types of the operands.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>1 == &quot;1&quot;  // true (number 1 converted to string &quot;1&quot;)
0 == false // true (false converted to number 0)
null == undefined // true (both are &quot;falsy&quot; values)</code></pre>
<pre><code>1 === &quot;1&quot;  // false (different types)
0 === false // false (different types)
null === undefined // false (different types)</code></pre>

<p>I was super busy today fixing a bunch of bugs. I hope I'll have time
to learn new things tmr.</p>
<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>One problem from codeforces to get familiar with Go</li>
<li>Check if I can reuse the CSS I used five years ago to format this
Nippo</li>
