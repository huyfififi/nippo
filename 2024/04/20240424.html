<h2 id="fmt-vs-bufio-to-read-stdin">fmt vs bufio to read stdin</h2>
<p>I browsed some web pages and documents but could not find any clear
guides or benchmarks, but here are my guesses</p>
<h3 id="bufio-is-more-performance-efficient">bufio is more performance
efficient</h3>
<p>People on Reddit say that, but I'm not sure at the moment as I
haven't tested by myself.</p>
<h3 id="bufio-is-more-flexible">bufio is more flexible</h3>
<p>fmt.Scan() or its variants read <em>space-separated</em> values
whereas bufio seems to provide many functions to process data.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-for-me">Conclusion (for me)</h3>
<p>There's no strong urge to use <code>bufio</code>. Let's use
<code>fmt.Scan</code> to read standard input for now.</p>

<h3 id="competitive-programming">Competitive Programming</h3>
<p>What I don't like about competitive programming is that no one writes
code that is understandable from others' perspectives. They don't write
comments and don't use descriptive variable names to make it hard to
hack (point out bugs) their submissions, and the technique goes against
real-life situations.</p>
<h3 id="color-filter">Color Filter</h3>
<p>Life is too vivid. I've enabled Color Filters on my iPhone and
MacBook, and now they only display black &amp; white. It helped me
reduce time spent on YouTube and others.</p>

<h3 id="loneliness">Loneliness</h3>
<p>I don't have experience with successful teamwork.</p>
<p>I only did single-player sports (karate, badminton, and pro
wrestling) and am jealous of the atmosphere people who play team sports
have.</p>
<p>I have found it very difficult to motivate others in the same
direction, not only in sports but also in programming or business. I
tried to publish mobile applications and simple video games, but my
friends seemed not to like the projects.</p>
<p>I just wanted to have a good time in the same way as playing tag when
we were in elementary school, but now we got old and have parted
ways.</p>
