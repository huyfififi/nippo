- Visited Japan Innovation Campus
	- [https://jp-innovation-campus.org/](https://jp-innovation-campus.org/)
	- The co-working space is free for Japanese entrepreneur. Of course I\'m not an entrepreneur, but I could drop in today.
	- It was fun working from the place. The atmosphere reminded me of old school days.
	- I don\'t get why people do networking. Meaningful networks consist of colleagues or close friends; exchanging cards is meaningless. I understand that talking to people with unique experience is interesting though.

## Retry: [1993C. Light Switches](https://codeforces.com/contest/1993/problem/C)

I could not solve this problem during the contest, but after some struggle, I managed to pass the tests.

- Each room repeats the statuses (on and off) every `2 * k` minutes.
- If there is a timing all the lights are turned on, it is `amax <= t <= amax + k`.
	- `t < amax`: the last room\'s light are off.
	- `t > amax + 2k`: repeating the same pattern, and they are not the earliest moment.
- Consider the time the last chip is installed as a base.
- Move all the switch cycle closest to the base
- Return the earliest intersection

```
from collections import defaultdict


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))

    amax: int = max(a)
    amod: list[int] = [x + (amax - x) // (2 * k) * (2 * k) for x in a]
    amod = [x + 2 * k if amax - x > k else x for x in amod]
    amodmax = max(amod)
    amodmin = min(amod)
    if amodmax - amodmin < k:
        print(amodmax)
    else:
        print(-1)
```
