I don\'t have any motivation left in my brain... I will lie on the bed.

## [1998A. Find K Distinct Points with Fixed Center](https://codeforces.com/contest/1998/problem/A)

Simply keep adding two points on both sides centered with the given point.

`1 <= k <= 1000` and `-100 <= xc, yc <= 100`, so this approach does not make `xi` and `yi` exceed the limit.

In hindsight, the solve() function seems to be confusing, but I\'ll let it as it is. I hope I can write more readable code next time. 

```
def solve(xc: int, yc: int, k: int) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:
    ans: list[tuple[int, int]] = []

    if k % 2 == 1:
        ans.append((xc, yc))
        k -= 1

    ce: int = 1
    while k > 0:
        ans.append((xc - ce * k, yc - ce * k))
        ans.append((xc + ce * k, yc + ce * k))
        k -= 2
    return ans


for _ in range(int(input())):
    xc, yc, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans: list[tuple[int, int]] = solve(xc, yc, k)
    assert len(ans) == k
    assert sum([x for x, y in ans]) // k == xc
    assert sum([y for x, y in ans]) // k== yc
    for x, y in ans:
        print(f"{x} {y}")
```
