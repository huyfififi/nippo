I feel hot. I\'m not sure if it\'s because I ran a long distance today or because the temperature in my room is actually high.

I wanted to do push-ups, but my wrists hurt. I will buy wrist wraps to reduce the damage of push-ups exercise.

## Checked `docker stats` in my Mastodon instance

My mastodon server sometimes go down due to CPU burst.

I haven\'t configured logs, and also Amazon Lightsail is not very stable, so I have no idea what were the root causes of server down. I only know that there were CPU bursts by checking the Lightsail dashboard.

```
$ docker stats --no-stream

```

I\'m using Amazon Lightsail VPS, and its sustainable CPU usage is 20% of max. As I checked the CPU usage, it seems not to be a problem.

My guesstimate is that the server runs out of memory (why?), resulting high CPU usage.

The issue happens even if I don\'t open the Mastodon website, i.e., the main API backend is not processing heavily.

Maybe the processes to accept requests from other instances and process them in the background get too many requests and go burst.

I\'m not sure.
