<p>spent most of today on my bed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read “衛府の七忍”
<ul>
<li>There are many characters from the author's other comics, and it was
interesting to see them alive again.</li>
<li>His skills at art is exceptional.</li>
<li>The story line is sort of boring.</li>
<li>The actions are not very exciting, compared to other famous comics
such as Jujutsu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Set an alarm for tomorrow (but not sure I will sleep before the
Codeforces contest)</li>
<li>Retried 1884B with a binary search approach, but I could not think
of any solutions with it. The only solution I could come up with is one
using sum arrays.
<ul>
<li>The difficulty of Binary search is that the input array must be
sorted already</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
