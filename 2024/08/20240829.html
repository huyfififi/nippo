<p>I feel hot. I'm not sure if it's because I ran a long distance today
or because the temperature in my room is actually high.</p>
<p>I wanted to do push-ups, but my wrists hurt. I will buy wrist wraps
to reduce the damage of push-ups exercise.</p>

<p>My mastodon server sometimes go down due to CPU burst.</p>
<p>I haven't configured logs, and also Amazon Lightsail is not very
stable, so I have no idea what were the root causes of server down. I
only know that there were CPU bursts by checking the Lightsail
dashboard.</p>

<p>I'm using Amazon Lightsail VPS, and its sustainable CPU usage is 20%
of max. As I checked the CPU usage, it seems not to be a problem.</p>
<p>My guesstimate is that the server runs out of memory (why?),
resulting high CPU usage.</p>
<p>The issue happens even if I don't open the Mastodon website, i.e.,
the main API backend is not processing heavily.</p>
<p>Maybe the processes to accept requests from other instances and
process them in the background get too many requests and go burst.</p>
<p>I'm not sure.</p>
