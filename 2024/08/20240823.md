```
def possible(n: int, x: list[int]) -> bool:
    assert n >= 2

    # it's impossible to have a point that is the middle of three distinct points on the same axis line
    if n > 2:
        return False

    # the middle point is not an integer
    if x[1] - x[0] == 1:
        return False

    return True


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    x: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))

    if possible(n, x):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
