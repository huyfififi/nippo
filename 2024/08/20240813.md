Something that does not give me swift feedback is not interesting/attractive.

- Had dinner with my friend
	- My friend said that my talk was too logical and sounded like a robot.
	- I try to balance emotion and logic, but as I work hard to survive as a programmer here, I feel that I'm too inclined to my logical aspect.

## [1986C. Update Queries](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1986/C)

It\'s surprising that I\'m allowed to modify both `ind` and `c`. Anyting can be done with that power.

Duplicate indices will be ignored except for the first one, so I can reduce the `ind` array with unique elements.

Fill the unique indices with characters from the lexicographically smallest one.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s: list[str] = list(input())
    ind: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c: list[str] = list(input())

    unique_ind: list[int] = list(set(ind))
    unique_ind.sort()
    c.sort()

    for i in range(len(unique_ind)):
        s[unique_ind[i] - 1] = c[i]

    print("".join(s))
```
