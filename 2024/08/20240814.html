<p>I'm sleepy. luckily I don't have any meetings today. Let's make some
pull requests, do push-ups, and go to bed early.</p>
<p>There was an issue with GitHub servers. I could not check the code of
OSS online, could not read PyTorch, could not create pull requests. Is
it OK to heavily rely on GitHub to that degree??</p>
<p>I achieved today's quota. I will solve one easy Codeforces problem,
do push-ups, and go to bed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Checked how I solved 1986C before <a
href="../07/20240701.html">20240701</a>
<ul>
<li>The same approach as yesterday, but I prefer yesterday's solution as
it looks more intuitive.</li>
<li>but the solution listed on 20240701 also makes sense. They are
basically the same.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Coin</a></h2>
<p>The server had some issues, but I managed to submit my code
eventually.</p>
<p>When I run the game in my brain, as long as the character can keep
catching up to the falling coin in terms of Y-coordinate, X-axis does
not matter. They can just keep moving to the left/right to be in the
right spot.</p>
<pre><code>n: int = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    xi, yi = map(int, input().split())
    if yi &gt;= -1:
        print(&quot;YES&quot;)
    else:
        print(&quot;NO&quot;)</code></pre>
