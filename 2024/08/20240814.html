<p>I'm sleepy. luckily I don't have any meetings today. Let's make some
pull requests, do push-ups, and go to bed early.</p>
<p>There was an issue with GitHub servers. I could not check the code of
OSS online, could not read PyTorch, could not create pull requests. Is
it OK to heavily rely on GitHub to that degree??</p>
<p>I achieved today's quota. I will solve one easy Codeforces problem,
do push-ups, and go to bed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Checked how I solved 1986C before <a
href="../07/20240701.html">20240701</a>
<ul>
<li>The same approach as yesterday, but I prefer yesterday's solution as
it looks more intuitive.</li>
<li>but the solution listed on 20240701 also makes sense. They are
basically the same.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a.-catch-the-coin"><a

Coin</a></h2>
<p>The server had some issues, but I managed to submit my code
eventually.</p>
<p>When I run the game in my brain, as long as the character can keep
catching up to the falling coin in terms of Y-coordinate, X-axis does
not matter. They can just keep moving to the left/right to be in the
right spot.</p>
<pre><code>n: int = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    xi, yi = map(int, input().split())
    if yi &gt;= -1:
        print(&quot;YES&quot;)
    else:
        print(&quot;NO&quot;)</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Ketone 0 mg/dl</p>
<p>Because my bloodline is in Vietnam, I suspect I'm not good at Keto.
All kinds of Vietnamese food have rich carbohydrate, and my body might
be designed for them. The problem is, most of my relatives have
diabetes. My body is not good at fat-centered diet but not good at
carbo-centered diet at the same time. My body only works with
carbohydrate, but excessive carbohydrate would kill my body, too.</p>
<p>Diet has been a big problem for me through my life.</p>
<p>Salad 70g Protein shake 20g</p>
<p>Total carbohydrate 90 g</p>
<p>push-ups, walking, squats</p>
<p>I want to go jogging, but my feet have skin problems, so I cannot for
the time being.</p>
<hr />
<p>MUST:</p>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO:</p>

<li>Print out the document to explain the reason of passport
renewal</li>
