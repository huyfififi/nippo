## Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Miscellaneous

### [Bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html)

I was playing with Amazon S3 buckets and found out the bucket name must be globally unique across the Amazon Web Services. It\'s because the bucket name is directly used to form the URL of the bucket, and there are no other unique identifiers.

Also, I was surprised to see this

> For best compatibility, we recommend that you avoid using dots (.) in bucket names, except for buckets that are used only for static website hosting.
> If you include dots in a bucket\'s name, you can\'t use virtual-host-style addressing over HTTPS, unless you perform your own certificate validation.
> This is because the security certificates used for virtual hosting of buckets don\'t work for buckets with dots in their names.

I used dots (.) for the media storage of my Mastodon instance :annui: just realized that it was an anti-pattern.

### Create an Access Key for S3 buckets

IAM -> Create a user gruop with S3 access permissions -> create a user in the gruop -> create an access key for the user

By configuring the bucket name, aws access key id, and aws secret access key, I can access files from my application now.
