<h2 id="review-2003b.-turtle-and-piggy-are-playing-a-game-2">Review: <a
href="https://codeforces.com/contest/2003/problem/B">2003B. Turtle and
Piggy Are Playing a Game 2</a></h2>
<p>My assumption/approach</p>
<pre><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;
Turtle -&gt; remove the minimum value to increase the min of the array
Piggy -&gt; remove the maximum value to decrease the max of the array
indices (i, i + 1) do not matter; one operation removes one value from the array
&quot;&quot;&quot;
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    a: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    print(a[n // 2])</code></pre>
<p>but I'm not very sure that the optimal moves are greedy ones.</p>

<p>My approach seems to be correct, but I'm still not confident why it
always works.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm overthinking. Let's skip this for now.</p>
