- Browsed Discord API [https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference)
	- As expected, the API seems to be easy to use, but I could not come up with an interesting project. Anyway, I don\'t have any active Discord groups, so it\'s meaningless to develop a Discord application.
- Set an alarm for tomorrow
- Met my parents :angry:

## Retry: [1995B1. Bouquet (Easy Version) - 1100](https://codeforces.com/contest/1995/problem/B1)

```
from collections import defaultdict


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))

    c = defaultdict(int)
    for ai in a:
        c[ai] += 1

    ans: int = -1
    for k1, c1 in c.items():
        k2 = k1 + 1
        if k2 not in c:
            ans = max(ans, k1 * min(m // k1, c1))
            continue

        c2 = c[k2]
        for pc1 in range(1, c1 + 1):
            pv1: int = k1 * pc1
            rem: int = m - pv1
            if rem < 0:
                break
            ans = max(ans, pv1 + k2 * min(c2, (rem // k2)))

    assert ans <= m
    print(ans)
```

## [1999B. Card Game - 1000](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1999/B)

My solution

```
def suneet_win(su1: int, su2: int, sl1: int, sl2: int) -> bool:
    if su1 > sl1:
        return su2 >= sl2
    elif su1 == sl1:
        return su2 > sl2
    else:
        return False


for _ in range(int(input())):
    a1, a2, b1, b2 = map(int, input().split())

    # [(Suneet 1, Suneet 2, Slavic 1, Slavic 2)]
    # Beacuse of the symmetry, I can skip thinking about (a2, a1, ...) types
    # and double the ans in the end.
    combs: list[tuple[int, int, int, int]] = []
    combs.append((a1, a2, b1, b2))
    combs.append((a1, a2, b2, b1))

    ans: int = 0
    for comb in combs:
        if suneet_win(*comb):
            ans += 1
    print(ans * 2)
```

[Codeforces Round 964 (Div. 4) Editorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/132373)

The only direction it has is

> For each test case, we can brute force through all possible games (there are only four of them) and calculate who is the winner of the game by simulating the game.

I was overthinking.

I\'m not sure why this brute force problem has `1000` rating. Maybe people overthought same as me.
