- Visited the Consulate-General of Japan in San Francisco to receive the updated passport.
	- It takes more than one hour to drive to San Francisco, and now I\i'm tired from the long drive.
	- Parking lots in San Francisco are very expensive.
	- I hate the atomosphere of San Francisco.
	- The town is dirty and smells awful. There are many shady people.
	- Watched sea lions.
