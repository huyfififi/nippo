# 20240814

I\'m sleepy. luckily I don\'t have any meetings today. Let\'s make some pull requests, do push-ups, and go to bed early.

There was an issue with GitHub servers. I could not check the code of OSS online, could not read PyTorch, could not create pull requests. Is it OK to heavily rely on GitHub to that degree??

I achieved today\'s quota. I will solve one easy Codeforces problem, do push-ups, and go to bed.

- Checked how I solved 1986C before [20240701](../07/20240701.html)
	- The same approach as yesterday, but I prefer yesterday\'s solution as it looks more intuitive.
	- but the solution listed on 20240701 also makes sense. They are basically the same.

## [1989A. Catch the Coin](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1989/A)

The server had some issues, but I managed to submit my code eventually.

When I run the game in my brain, as long as the character can keep catching up to the falling coin in terms of Y-coordinate, X-axis does not matter. They can just keep moving to the left/right to be in the right spot.

```
n: int = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    xi, yi = map(int, input().split())
    if yi >= -1:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```
