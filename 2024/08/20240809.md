My skin has had problems. Maybe I have a nut allergy?

## [1979B. XOR Sequences](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1979/B)

Observation: maximum matching suffix?

[Codeforces Round 951 (Div. 2) Editorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/130213)

> Consider two numbers `v` and `u` such that `x xor v = y xor u`. Then consider the numbers `x xor (v + 1)` and `y xor (u + 1)`. Let\'s look at the last bit of `v` and `u`.

We\'re considering arbitrary numbers that elements from both sequences match.

> Possible scenarios:

> - Both bits are equal to 0 - adding one will change the bits at the same positions, therefore `x xor (v + 1) = y xor (u + 1)`;

> - Both bits are equal to 1 - adding one will change the bits at the same positions and also add one to the next bit, therefore we can similarly consider the next bit;

I guess this means `x xor (v + 1) = y for (u + 1)`, too.

> - Bits are different - adding one to the zero bit will only change one bit, while the subsequent bit of the other number will be changed. This means that `x xor (v + 1) != y xor (u + 1)`.

> It is clear that we need to maximize the number of zeros in the maximum matching suffix of `u` and `v`.

?

> Obviously, this number is equal to the maximum matching suffix of `x` and `y`.

:thinking\_face:

> Let `k` be the length of the maximum matching suffic of `x` and `y`, then the answer is `2 ** k`.

I think I understand the explanation 30%. I\'ll visit here again later to fully understand it.
