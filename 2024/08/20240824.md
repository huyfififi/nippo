# 20240824

spent most of today on my bed.

- Read "衛府の七忍"
	- There are many characters from the author\'s other comics, and it was interesting to see them alive again.
	- His skills at art is exceptional.
	- The story line is sort of boring.
	- The actions are not very exciting, compared to other famous comics such as Jujutsu.
- Set an alarm for tomorrow (but not sure I will sleep before the Codeforces contest)
