<li>Some people say it's better to configure a test environment to get
responses from external APIs. I agree to some extent, but for the
personal project, it's overkill, and also we don't have that much
time.</li>

<li>Tweaked the summary section of my LinkedIn profile
<ul>
<li>I'm not a big fan of LinkedIn, but it has helped me get a job. Maybe
it's better to maintain the profile sometimes.</li>

<li>Added some projects on my LinkedIn profile</li>

id="microservice-independency-should-i-have-a-dedicated-cachemessage-queue-for-a-microservice">Microservice
Independency: Should I have a dedicated cache/message queue for a
microservice?</h2>
<p>I googled some but did not find a direct guide on the topic, so I
considered it for some time and wrote this note for reference.</p>
<p>I was motivated to consider this because I was desining a
microservice with a dedicated cache and message queue, but my colleague
asked me not to do that. Unfortunately, neither of us had much knowledge
to explain the approahces to others.</p>
<p>My initial thought was that a dedicated cache could make the
microservice truly independent, and this fit our use case. My mind did
not change after checking web pages and some consideration.</p>
<p>For simplicity, I will assume we're talking about Redis (I hear that
Redis stopped being OSS, and we might want to migrate to other projects
such as dragonfly tho).</p>
<h3 id="pros-of-having-dedicated-redis-instances">Pros of having
dedicated Redis instances</h3>
<ul>
<li>Isolation
<ul>
<li>Issues in other services do not affect the microservice. Even if
some services go down, the microservice continues to serve for running
services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better performance
<ul>
<li>Workloads of other services do not affect the performance of the
microservice, making the performance consistent and preventing
contention.</li>
<li>Resources can be tuned, e.g., scale up/down, for the
microservice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better security
<ul>
<li>Because the Redis instance don't have to be open to multiple
services, it's easier to control access and manage security
policies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons-of-having-dedicated-redis-instances">Cons of having
dedicated Redis instances</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cost
<ul>
<li>Adding a new instance costs extra.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More complicated management
<ul>
<li>Adding a new instance increases the burden of configuring.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-for-the-microservice-i-designed">Conclusion for the
microservice I designed</h3>
<p>The microservice is used by multiple services, and its workload is
expected to increase hugely. Therefore, I believe having a dedicated
Redis instance is better in our case, from the technical standpoint.</p>
<p>However, DevOps engineers and I have been busy and occupied with
other tasks. It also makes sense not to add another overhead,
considering our current team structure.</p>
<p>I'll use the shared infastructure for now.</p>

Submission Bait</a></h2>
<p>Alice's winning strategy is to pick the most significant number with
odd counts first. This move makes the count of remaining numbers no more
than the first picked number even. After making the situation, any picks
Bob makes are followed by Alice's pick of the same number, leading to
Bob's defeat.</p>
<p>Simply put, Alice wins if there is a number with odd counts.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<pre><code>[2, 2, 3, 3] -&gt; (alice, bob) =&gt; [(2, 2), (3, 3)] or [(3, 3)] =&gt; Alice loses
[1, 2, 2, 3, 3] -&gt; (alice, bob) =&gt; [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, _)] or [(1, 3), (3, _)] =&gt; Alice wins</code></pre>
