<li>Some people say it's better to configure a test environment to get
responses from external APIs. I agree to some extent, but for the
personal project, it's overkill, and also we don't have that much
time.</li>

Independency: Should I have a dedicated cache/message queue for a
microservice?</h2>
<p>I googled some but did not find a direct guide on the topic, so I
considered it for some time and wrote this note for reference.</p>
<p>I was motivated to consider this because I was desining a
microservice with a dedicated cache and message queue, but my colleague
asked me not to do that. Unfortunately, neither of us had much knowledge
to explain the approahces to others.</p>
<p>My initial thought was that a dedicated cache could make the
microservice truly independent, and this fit our use case. My mind did
not change after checking web pages and some consideration.</p>
<p>For simplicity, I will assume we're talking about Redis (I hear that
Redis stopped being OSS, and we might want to migrate to other projects
such as dragonfly tho).</p>
<h3 id="pros-of-having-dedicated-redis-instances">Pros of having
dedicated Redis instances</h3>
<ul>
<li>Isolation
<ul>
<li>Issues in other services do not affect the microservice. Even if
some services go down, the microservice continues to serve for running
services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better performance
<ul>
<li>Workloads of other services do not affect the performance of the
microservice, making the performance consistent and preventing
contention.</li>
<li>Resources can be tuned, e.g., scale up/down, for the
microservice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better security
<ul>
<li>Because the Redis instance don't have to be open to multiple
services, it's easier to control access and manage security
policies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons-of-having-dedicated-redis-instances">Cons of having
dedicated Redis instances</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cost
<ul>
<li>Adding a new instance costs extra.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More complicated management
<ul>
<li>Adding a new instance increases the burden of configuring.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-for-the-microservice-i-designed">Conclusion for the
microservice I designed</h3>
<p>The microservice is used by multiple services, and its workload is
expected to increase hugely. Therefore, I believe having a dedicated
Redis instance is better in our case, from the technical standpoint.</p>
<p>However, DevOps engineers and I have been busy and occupied with
other tasks. It also makes sense not to add another overhead,
considering our current team structure.</p>
<p>I'll use the shared infastructure for now.</p>
