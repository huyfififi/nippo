I was super busy configuring GitHub Actions\' testing workflow to test classifying a custom machine-learning model. Because machine-learning models are too big to have in a GitHub repository, I upload the model to an Amazon S3 bucket and make the workflow download it when running tests.

I\'m hungry, but don\'t feel I\'m losing weight. Theoretically, I should measure my weight every morning, but I\'m too afraid of facing reality...

I still have more than two weeks before the next vacation...
