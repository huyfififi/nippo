# 20240815

I cannot join the next Codeforces contest because I have meetings that day. disappointed: 10%, relieved 90%. I can (to some extent) relax this week.

My relatives force me to eat Vietnamese food. The atmosphere made me feel nostalgic.

It seems the Codeforces server is down, and my code is not run.

TODO: Check the result and review it tomorrow 20240816

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    a: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))

    if len(set(a)) == 1:
        print("NO")
        continue

    print("YES")
    if a[0] != a[1]:
        print("R" * (n - 1) + "B")
    else:
        print("B" + "R" * (n - 1))
```

The end of Keto. This was the third time I tried Keto, and I think I have enough data that I\'m not good at it.

To be positive, it was a good progress that I could confirm Keto did not work for me.

will go back to low fat diet
