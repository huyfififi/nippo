naming rules</a></h3>
<p>I was playing with Amazon S3 buckets and found out the bucket name
must be globally unique across the Amazon Web Services. It's because the
bucket name is directly used to form the URL of the bucket, and there
are no other unique identifiers.</p>
<p>Also, I was surprised to see this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For best compatibility, we recommend that you avoid using dots (.) in
bucket names, except for buckets that are used only for static website
hosting. If you include dots in a bucket's name, you can't use
virtual-host-style addressing over HTTPS, unless you perform your own
certificate validation. This is because the security certificates used
for virtual hosting of buckets don't work for buckets with dots in their
names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used dots (.) for the media storage of my Mastodon instance :annui:
just realized that it was an anti-pattern.</p>
<h3 id="create-an-access-key-for-s3-buckets">Create an Access Key for S3
buckets</h3>
<p>IAM -&gt; Create a user gruop with S3 access permissions -&gt; create
a user in the gruop -&gt; create an access key for the user</p>
<p>By configuring the bucket name, aws access key id, and aws secret
access key, I can access files from my application now.</p>
