- Video call with my relatives in Vietnam
	- That was a good experience. One of my cousin is learning Japanese, and her Japanese is so cute.
	- I am considering cutting a relationship with my parents, but other relatives are actually nice. It\'s a tough situation.

["When life gives you lemons, make lemonade"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_life_gives_you_lemons,_make_lemonade) is my friend\'s favorite proverbial phrase.

At first glance, I thought the proverb meant "bloom where God has planted you," but I was wrong.

The proberb means you are responsible for making your life cheerful, and lemons here are a metaphor for life's challenges.

I had a chance to talk with a software engineer at Amazon, and he said that engineers there work at least 60 hours a week.

It would be a great opportunity to grow if I was a fresher who had just graduated from college, but I got old (to some extent) and had no energy left in me to burn.

I need to wake up early tomorrow. It\'s daunting... though my circadian rhythm is almost repaired.

## [1971E. Find the Car](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1971/E)

Wow, I managed to solve the problem without references.

1. find the section `d` belongs to
1. calculate the offset

```
def find_section(k: int, a: list[int], d: int) -> int:
    # binary search
    li: int = 0
    ri: int = k
    while li < ri - 1:
        mi: int = (li + ri) // 2
        if a[mi] == d:
            return mi
        elif a[mi] < d:
            li = mi
        else:
            ri = mi
    return li


for tc in range(int(input())):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a: list[int] = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b: list[int] = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

    ans: list[int] = []
    for qc in range(q):
        d: int = int(input())
        i: int = find_section(k, a, d)

        if a[i] == d:
            ans.append(b[i])
            continue

        _ans: int = b[i] + (d - a[i]) * (b[i + 1] - b[i]) // (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        ans.append(_ans)

    print(" ".join([str(x) for x in ans]))
```
