["When life gives you lemons, make lemonade"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_life_gives_you_lemons,_make_lemonade) is my friend\'s favorite proverbial phrase.

At first glance, I thought the proverb meant "bloom where God has planted you," but I was wrong.

The proberb means you are responsible for making your life cheerful, and lemons here are a metaphor for life's challenges.

I had a chance to talk with a software engineer at Amazon, and he said that engineers there work at least 60 hours a week.

It would be a great opportunity to grow if I was a fresher who had just graduated from college, but I got old (to some extent) and had no energy left in me to burn.
