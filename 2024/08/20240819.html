<li>Video call with my relatives in Vietnam
<ul>
<li>That was a good experience. One of my cousin is learning Japanese,
and her Japanese is so cute.</li>
<li>I am considering cutting a relationship with my parents, but other
relatives are actually nice. It's a tough situation.</li>

<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_life_gives_you_lemons,_make_lemonade">“When
life gives you lemons, make lemonade”</a> is my friend's favorite
proverbial phrase.</p>
<p>At first glance, I thought the proverb meant “bloom where God has
planted you,” but I was wrong.</p>
<p>The proberb means you are responsible for making your life cheerful,
and lemons here are a metaphor for life’s challenges.</p>

<p>I had a chance to talk with a software engineer at Amazon, and he
said that engineers there work at least 60 hours a week.</p>
<p>It would be a great opportunity to grow if I was a fresher who had
just graduated from college, but I got old (to some extent) and had no
energy left in me to burn.</p>
<hr />
<p>I need to wake up early tomorrow. It's daunting… though my circadian
rhythm is almost repaired.</p>
