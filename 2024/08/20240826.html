<h3 id="my-idea">My idea</h3>
<p><code>k = 2</code> is the simplest scenario, and if it's impossible
with <code>k = 2</code>, it's also impossible with
<code>k &gt;= 3</code>.</p>
<p>When we think about <code>k = 3</code>, the first character of
<code>t1</code> must be different from last characters of
<code>t2</code> and <code>t3</code>, but the condition is more strict
than thinking about only <code>t1</code> v.s. <code>t2</code>.
Therefore, I only consider <code>k = 2</code> for simplicity's sake.
(not very confident about the explanation).</p>
<p>When <code>k = 2</code>, we just have to check if there is a pair of
<code>(t1, t2)</code> where
<code>t1[0] != t2[-1] and t1[-1] != t2[0]</code>.</p>
<pre><code>def possible(n: int, s: list[str]) -&gt; bool:
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] != s[i + 1]:
            return s[0] != s[n - 1]
    return False


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    s: list[str] = list(input())
    if possible(n, s):
        print(&quot;YES&quot;)
    else:
        print(&quot;NO&quot;)</code></pre>

editorial</h3>
<p><a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/132953">Codeforces Round
968 (Div. 2) Editorial</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A necessary condition for <code>s</code> to be good is that
<code>s1 != sn</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For a string <code>s</code> where <code>s1 != sn</code>, let
<code>t1</code> be a string composed of just the simple character
<code>s1</code>, and let <code>t2</code> be a string composed of the
<code>n - 1</code> characters from <code>s2</code> to
<code>sn</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this way, the condition is satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, if <code>s1</code> != <code>sn</code>, the answer is
“Yes”; otherwise, the answer is “No”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I misunderstood the problem. I thought <code>t2</code>'s first
character must not be equal to <code>t1</code>'s last character, but the
condition is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all <code>1 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt;= k</code>, the first character of
<code>ti</code> isn't equal to the last character of <code>tj</code>. We
only have to compare the first character of <code>ti</code> with the
last characters of strings come after <code>ti</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is as simple as</p>
<pre><code>for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    s: str = input()
    if s[0] != s[-1]:
        print(&quot;YES&quot;)
    else:
        print(&quot;NO&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>Python's sorting algorithm is known as Timsort, which is a
combination of Merge sort and Insertion sort. The best-case time
complexity of the Insertion Sort is O(n), and leveraging the fact
improves the time complexity of Merge Sort, which is O(nlogn) at best.
As I remember correctly, the reason why Quick Sort is not used is that
Quick Sort does not retain the order of elements.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Quicksort -
Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most implementations of quicksort are not stable, meaning that the
relative order of equal sort items is not preserved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even an amateur programmer like myself knows the name Tim Peters, who
is the inventor of Timsort. Also, he is known as an author of “Zen of
Python,” which heavily impacted my life as a programmer.</p>
<p>It's surprising to know that he has been suspended from the Python
council.</p>
<p>Most of the communications happening seem to be private, but as far
as I read the Chris's blog and Lunduke's one, the suspension of Tim
seems to be unreasonable.</p>
<p>I don't have enough information to judge the situation, and I also
don't have the power to influence the community, but I just hope the
Python community and its ecosystem will not fall apart.</p>
