My circadian rhythm is broken again... participating Codeforces rounds is simply difficult...I cannot focus...

- Participated in [Codeforces Round 968 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2003)
	- My solutions for A and B passed pre-tests
	- I think I did well. My goal is to solve 1\~3 problems in a Div.2 round
	- My rating decreased drastically tho.
- Set an alarm for tomorrow. I need to visit San Francisco.
- Sent an email to a lawyer
- Sent an email to a hose leasing agent

Mexican rice 500
Rice 800
Keto drink 100

Total 1400 kcal

3k run, stretch, abs, push-ups

I was planning to go for 6k, but the damages from the 10k run from last Thursday remain.

I can\'t believe my friend runs over 300km in an ultra marathon.

I need to reduce my weight to run longer miles.
