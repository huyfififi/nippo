# 20240825

My circadian rhythm is broken again... participating Codeforces rounds is simply difficult...I cannot focus...

- Participated in [Codeforces Round 968 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2003)
	- My solutions for A and B passed pre-tests
	- I think I did well. My goal is to solve 1\~3 problems in a Div.2 round
- Set an alarm for tomorrow. I need to visit San Francisco.
