<ul>
<li>I'm bored. My friends are not active on their personal projects. To
be honest, I have no idea why it takes that much time to make small
changes, and it makes me a bit jittery, though great engineers would
think the same thing about me.
<ul>
<li>I always try to provide evidence or references when making
arguments, trying not to hurt one's feelings at the same time, but it
seems not everyone appreciates that.</li>
<li>Maybe I'm too tired, having meetings. Let's go to bedâ€¦</li>

<h2 id="jenkins-and-github-actions">Jenkins and GitHub Actions</h2>
<h3 id="differences-between-them">Differences between them</h3>
<p>Motivation: I have a project that uses Jenkins to deploy code to
development environments. I want to auto-trigger the build/deploy when
merging pull requests to a dev branch.</p>
<p><a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/migrating-to-github-actions/manually-migrating-to-github-actions/migrating-from-jenkins-to-github-actions">Migrating
from Jenkins to GitHub Actions</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jenkins and GitHub Actions both allow you to create workflows that
automatically build, test, publish, release, and deploy code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there syntaxes are different, Their basic capabilities are
the same, as I browsed the document.</p>
<p>The documentation above shows the syntax differences, and it seems
due to the similarities, it's easy to migrate from Jenkins to GitHub
Actions.</p>

it possible to simply trigger Jenkins pipelines from GitHub?</h3>
<p>I searched for a Jenkins integration in GitHub workflow templates,
but nothing hit.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/remote-access-api/">Remote
Access API - jenkins.io</a></p>
<p>There is an API to which I can send a request to trigger a specific
job, but because I cannot notice any errors in the pipeline if I send a
request from GitHub Actions, i.e., there is no complete integration,
there is little advantage of doing that.</p>
<h3 id="my-conclusion">My conclusion</h3>
<p>For a small project, using GitHub Actions is better (when using
GitHub as a Git repository server) because running and managing Jenkins
servers correctly require engineering resources, whereas with GitHub, I
don't have to worry about the infrastructure much. Also, GitHub Actions
have free minutes to run workflows, which usually does not exceed the
limit for a small project/organization. Thinking about hosting a Jenkins
server and engineering hours to manage its infrastructures, leveraging
GitHub Actions is much more cost-efficient.</p>
<p><a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions">About
billing for GitHub Actions</a></p>
<p>Let's say we use GitHub Team, because GitHub Enterprise Cloud is
overkill for a small-mid size startup, we have 3000 free minutes per
month, which is ~= 100 minutes per day.</p>
<p>From my experience,</p>
<ul>
<li>Running linters =&gt; ~1 minute</li>
<li>Running tests =&gt; 5 minutes</li>
<li>Deployment =&gt; 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Roughly, one pull request consumes 10 minutes of resources. 10 pull
requests can be run freely. If we exceed the limit, Linux-based OS
runners cost $0.008, so each addtiional pull request only costs
$0.08.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with the best practice of Jenkins infrastructure,
but if we go for a very simple infrastructure such as VPS, it costs
around $30 per month including domains.</p>
<p>Also, managing Jenkins pipeline costs some engineering-hour, which is
not free.</p>
