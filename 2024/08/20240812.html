<p>Finished must-be-done items. Let's relax for the rest of the day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipped the document to the Consulate-General of Japan</li>
<li>Submitted a DL renewal request at the office.
<ul>
<li>There are so many people in that office. Now, I'm kind of
tired.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Checked 1979B editorial and updated my note on that problem <a
href="./20240809.html">20240809</a></li>
<li>I had too much momentum and created many pull requests.</li>
</ul>

Equal Sum Subarrays</a></h2>
<p>As I looked at the number of contestants who solved the problem, it
seemed that it was not as difficult as I thought.</p>

965 (Div. 2) Editorial</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can always construct a solution such that the number of pairs
<code>(i, j)</code> is 1 where the only pair is <code>(1, n)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There exists several constructions, such as rotating <code>p</code>
once or increment all <code>pi</code> (and <code>pi = n</code> turns
into <code>pi = 1</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the former construction, where
<code>q = [p2, p3, ..., pn, p1]</code>. For an arbitrarily interval
<code>[i, j]</code>, <code>p[i..j]</code> and <code>[i..j]</code> will
have exactly 1 element that's different, disregarding ordering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That totally makes sense now.</p>

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    p: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = [p[-1]] + p[:-1]
    print(&quot; &quot;.join([str(x) for x in q]))</code></pre>

<p>Ketone 0 mg/dl I drank too much water today and I suspect that makes
the denominator very large, so that the mg/dl became nearly zero, but
not sure</p>
