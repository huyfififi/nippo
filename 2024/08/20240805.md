- updated my resume with the sign up feature
- updated my resume with the document structure and AWS S3
- added some more bullet points
- completed updating my resume and asked my wife to review it
	- I\'m not considering changing jobs at the moment tho

## Review: [1993A. Question Marks](https://codeforces.com/contest/1993/problem/A)

For every option, `n` score can be obtained at most.

```
from collections import defaultdict


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    s: list[str] = list(input())

    d: defaultdict = defaultdict(int)
    for x in s:
        d[x] += 1

    score: int = 0
    score += min(d["A"], n)
    score += min(d["B"], n)
    score += min(d["C"], n)
    score += min(d["D"], n)
    print(score)
```

## Review: [1993B. Parity and Sum](https://codeforces.com/contest/1993/problem/B)

Observation:

- With the given operation, we can only turn even numbers into odd numbers to meet the condition except for a corner case where all the elements are even.
- To update a parity, an odd number and an even number smaller than the odd number must be chosen.
	- When the maximum odd number is bigger than an even number, the even number can be replaced with an odd number in 1 operation.
	- Otherwise, the maximum odd number needs to be increased by adding the even number chosen. And then, the even number can be replaced with a new odd number. 2 operations in total.
- To avoid the additional operation that does not change parity but increases the maximum odd number, keep choosing the largest odd number and the smallest even number.
	- Suppose it\'s not possible to make the temporary most significant odd onumber larger than even numbers. In that case, the optimal solution is to choose the largest odd number and the largest even number in the first operation, creating a new odd number that is larger than all the evens.

```
def solve(n: int, a: list[int]) -> int:
    evens: list[int] = [x for x in a if x % 2 == 0]
    odds: list[int] = [x for x in a if x % 2 == 1]

    if len(evens) == n or len(odds) == n:
        return 0

    evens.sort()
    oddmax: int = max(odds)

    for x in evens:
        if oddmax > x:
            oddmax += x
        else:
            return len(evens) + 1
    return len(evens)


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    a: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))

    ans: int = solve(n, a)
    print(ans)
```
