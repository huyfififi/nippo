## Review: [1993A. Question Marks](https://codeforces.com/contest/1993/problem/A)

For every option, `n` score can be obtained at most.

```
from collections import defaultdict


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    s: list[str] = list(input())

    d: defaultdict = defaultdict(int)
    for x in s:
        d[x] += 1

    score: int = 0
    score += min(d["A"], n)
    score += min(d["B"], n)
    score += min(d["C"], n)
    score += min(d["D"], n)
    print(score)
```
