- Read "覚悟のススメ" and "戦隊レッド 異世界で冒険者になる". They were very good.
- Did the laundry.
- I have no energy to do anything. My brain and body might be damaged.
- I browsed the problem set of Codeforces, but very few problems with difficulty between 900~1100 (my current target) exist.

## [1977A. Little Nikita - 800](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1977/A)

It\'s possible to make the tower height `m` if the remaining moves are couples of `(+1, -1)`.

```
def possible_math(n: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if n < m:
        return False
    return (n - m) % 2 == 0


def possible_greedy(n: int, m: int) -> bool:
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if m == i - (n - i):
            return True
    return False


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if possible_math(n, m):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

## [1974B. Symmetric Encoding - 800](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1974/B)

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    b: list[str] = list(input())

    r: list[str] = sorted(list(set(b)))
    mapping: dict[str, str] = {}
    for i in range(len(r)):
        mapping[r[i]] = r[-(i + 1)]  # This might come in handy in the future..

    for i in range(n):
        b[i] = mapping[b[i]]

    print("".join(b))
```
