# 20240812

Finished must-be-done items. Let\'s relax for the rest of the day.

- Shipped the document to the Consulate-General of Japan
- Submitted a DL renewal request at the office.
	- There are so many people in that office. Now, I\'m kind of tired.
- Checked 1979B editorial and updated my note on that problem [20240809](./20240809.html)
- I had too much momentum and created many pull requests.

## [1998B. Minimize Equal Sum Subarrays](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1998/B)

As I looked at the number of contestants who solved the problem, it seemed that it was not as difficult as I thought.

[Codeforces Round 965 (Div. 2) Editorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/130647)

> We can always construct a solution such that the number of pairs `(i, j)` is 1 where the only pair is `(1, n)`.

> There exists several constructions, such as rotating `p` once or increment all `pi` (and `pi = n` turns into `pi = 1`).

> Consider the former construction, where `q = [p2, p3, ..., pn, p1]`. For an arbitrarily interval `[i, j]`, `p[i..j]` and `[i..j]` will have exactly 1 element that\'s different, disregarding ordering.

That totally makes sense now.

```
"""
one of the possible solutions
"""
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    p: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = [p[-1]] + p[:-1]
    print(" ".join([str(x) for x in q]))
```

Ketone 0 mg/dl I drank too much water today and I suspect that makes the denominator very large, so that the mg/dl became nearly zero, but not sure
