<p>I want to finish reading chapter 4 of “Designing Data-Intensive
Applications” and tackle two Codeforces problems, if possible…</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtained the WiFi password for the co-working space in my
apartment</li>
<li>Updated the Mastodon version of my server.
<ul>
<li>Things go smoothly after adding additional RAM.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Updated MacBook’s OS version</li>
<li>Bought some party stuff at Dollar Tree</li>
<li>Played the trending game, Pokemon TCG Pocket, with my wife
<ul>
<li>It was fun. Sometimes, I need some time like this with my wife.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Made progress on reading “Designing Data-Intensive Applications”
<ul>
<li>The section I’m reading has been a good refresher for things I
studied a long time ago.</li>

id="the-reason-why-metas-llama-models-and-llamaindex-use-the-word-llama">The
reason why Meta’s Llama models and LlamaIndex use the word “Llama”</h2>
<p>Although they share the name <em>Llama</em>, they are very different
components from each other.</p>

- Introducing Llama: A foundamental, 65-billion-parameter large language
model</a></p>
<p>Meta’s model <em>Llama</em> stands for <em>Large Language Model Meta
AI</em>.</p>

<p>As I googled the company information, the company “LlamaIndex” has no
relationship with Meta.</p>

- Why is everyone in AI talking about Llamas? by Logan
Kilpatrick</a></p>
<p>LlamaIndex seems to be the first one to use the word <em>Llama</em>,
and it was picked because the word has <em>LLM</em> in it. Moreover, it
can evoke the image of a cute and friendly animal.</p>
<p>So, it is just a coincidence that they share the same name.</p>
