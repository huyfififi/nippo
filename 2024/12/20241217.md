- went to a nearby cafe, Big Mug Coffee, for the first time.
	- They serve good coffee and have WiFi, but the desks and chairs are not comfortable. Also, the ambient music was too loud.
- made progress on reading "Desining Data-Intensive Applications"

> Observe that if you have an array where all elements are unique, they will all have frequency 1, therefore they can all be classified as the mode.

Here is my solution.

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    a: list[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))

    s: set[int] = set()
    j: int = 1
    b: list[int] = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] not in s:
            b.append(a[i])
            s.add(a[i])
        else:
            while j in s:
                j += 1
            b.append(j)
            s.add(j)
    print(" ".join([str(x) for x in b]))
```
