McDonald's seasonal menu McRib was not very tasty.

## [2040C. Ordered Permutations - 1200](https://codeforces.com/contest/2040/problem/C)

:thinking\_face:

I can't understand or replicate the solution, but the way they construct a permutation might be worth remembering.

Instead of generating all permutations `n!`, the solution picks two positions (the leftmost/rightmost blank spaces) for each number so that only `2^n` permutations need to be checked.

## [2044A. Easy Problem - 800](https://codeforces.com/contest/2044/problem/A)

The problem can be rephrased as counting how many different ways we can insert a partition between `n` identical blocks.

For example, consider the number 5 expressed as:

5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

Some of possible ways to place a single partition are:

- 1 + 1 | 1 + 1 + 1 (a = 2, b = 3)
- 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 | 1 (a = 4, b = 1)

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(int(input()) - 1)
```

## [2044B. Normal Problem - 800](https://codeforces.com/contest/2044/problem/B)

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s: list[str] = list(input())
    srev: list[str] = s[::-1]
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if srev[i] == "p":
            srev[i] = "q"
        elif srev[i] == "q":
            srev[i] = "p"
    print("".join(srev))
```
