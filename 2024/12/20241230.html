Applications”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Eventual Consistency</em>
<ul>
<li>When using a leader-based replication setup, the read replica might
not always have the latest data from the leader. However, eventual
consistency ensures that the read replica will catch up over time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Read-After-Write Consistency</em>
<ul>
<li>“This guarantee that if the user reloads the page, they will always
see any updates they submitted themselves.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Monotonic Reads</em>
<ul>
<li>“…monotonic reads only means that if one user makes several reads in
sequence, they will not see time go backward.”</li>
<li>It can be achieved to make reads from a user go to the same read
replica.</li>
<li><em>Failover</em> needs to be handled carefully otherwise the user
cannot read data when its replica is down.</li>
