<p>Oh, there is another Codeforces Round tomorrow, but I already
participated two contests this week… I’m tired</p>
<ul>
<li>Codeforces Global Round 28
<ul>
<li>My rating exceeded 1200, and I became a Pupil. Yay!!!</li>
<li>I drank too much coffee to join the contest, and now I feel really
sick.</li>
<li>I received a message from an unknown user asking for my solution
during the contest. It’s kind of funny.</li>
<li>I understand the desire to achieve a good rating as soon as
possible, but focusing on self-improvement is far more important. Using
ChatGPT during contests might improve my rating, but it feels like
competing in a marathon while riding a bicycle. The true beauty of
competition lies in pushing human limits.</li>
