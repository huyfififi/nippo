RPC and REST: Communication Paradigm / Architectural Style</h4>
<p><a

vs REST - Difference Between API Architectures - AWS</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and REST are two architectural styles in
API design… RPC APIs allow developers to call remote functions in
external servers as if they were local to their software… In contrast,
REST APIs allow you to perform specific data operations on a remote
server…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this book, Martin points out that communication over the internet
is fundamentally different from making function calls, and treating a
remote service as if it were a local object in a programming language
introduces various problems, restricting the focus to requests between
services owned by the same organization.</p>
<p>RESTful API, which means API developed with REST guidelines, is much
easier to work with. Developers can easily send requests to the API with
<code>curl</code> or <code>Postman</code>, while they need to write some
code to work with RPC.</p>
<h4 id="misc-soap-and-rest-protocol-specification">Misc: SOAP and REST:
Protocol Specification</h4>
<p>Technically, I cannot directly compare SOAP and REST because SOAP is
a protocol specification standardized by the W3C while REST provides
guidelines to design a service conceptually. (I’m gettting confused and
not very sure!)</p>
<p><a

vs REST - Difference Between API Technologies - AWS</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>SOAP and REST are two different approaches to API design. The SOAP
approach is highly structured and uses XML data format. REST is more
flexible and allows applications to exchange data in multiple
formats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_wsdl.asp">w3shools.com -
XML WSDL</a></p>
<p>The API of a SOAP web service follows WSDL, which stands for Web
Services Description Language, and because its structure is too
complicated for humans to craft requests or read responses manually,
users of SOAP are forced to use some tools to cope with the API. When
using programming languages that don’t have good support for SOAP, it
will be very difficult to integrate with the SOAL API.</p>
<p>My only experience with SOAP is Salesforce API, and it was pretty
tricky to work with. As I browsed blogs and web pages, it seems to be
safe to consider SOAP as a sort of dead technology, though some large
enterprises still use it to leverage its strict standards.</p>
<h2 id="encoding">Encoding</h2>
<p>It is common practice to perform rolling upgrades, where a new
version of a service is deployed to a subset of nodes and eventually
replaces all nodes. With this approach, we can release a new version of
a service without downtime, and it’s easier to detect issues and revert
the release.</p>
<p>However, it introduces a problem that needs careful handling: the
presence of pods running both older and newer versions simultaneously.
This issue is not limited to rolling upgrades: it can also occur when
exposing API endpoints to third-party clients that may be using outdated
versions.</p>
<p>To address this problem, it is crucial to select a data encoding
format that supports both backward compatibility (allowing new code to
read old data) and forward compatibility (enabling old code to read new
data).</p>
<p>Programming language-specific encodings are not recommended because
they are tightly coupled with specific programming languages. Also, they
tend to fail to provide backward/forward compatibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html">pickle -
Python object serialization</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pickle serialization format is guaranteed to be backwards
compatible across Python releases provided a compatible pickle protocol
is chosen and pickling and unpickling code deals with Python 2 to Python
3 type differences if your data is crossing that unique breaking change
language boundary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I browsed some web pages, and Python’s encoding library
<code>pickle</code> seems not to be forward compatible as the
documentation does not mention it.</p>
<p>There are binary encodings that are backward compatible and forward
compatible. One of them is Apache Avro, which achieves backward/forward
compatibility under some conditions.</p>
<p>The most popular encoding is textual formats like JSON, XML, and CSV,
where JSON is widespread due to its readability. Their backward
compatibility and forward compatibility are achieved by how they are
used in implementation.</p>
