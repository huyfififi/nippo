<p>Backward compatibility: the ability of a system, device, or software
to work with older versions or iterations.</p>
<p>When a single process is used to access a database, the process must
have backward compatibility. That is because the database may have old
data written using an old version process.</p>
<p>When multiple processes run to read/write data to a database, the
software to access the database must have forward compatibility in
addition to backward compatibility. That is because a process with an
older version may read data that are written by a newer version.</p>
