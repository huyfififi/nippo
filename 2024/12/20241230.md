- made progress on reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"

	- *Eventual Consistency*
		- When using a leader-based replication setup, the read replica might not always have the latest data from the leader. However, eventual consistency ensures that the read replica will catch up over time.

	- *Read-After-Write Consistency*
		- "This guarantee that if the user reloads the page, they will always see any updates they submitted themselves."

	- *Monotonic Reads*
		- "...monotonic reads only means that if one user makes several reads in sequence, they will not see time go backward."
		- It can be achieved to make reads from a user go to the same read replica.
		- *Failover* needs to be handled carefully otherwise the user cannot read data when its replica is down.
