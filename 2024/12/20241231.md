- made progress on reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"
	- *Consistent Prefix Reads*
	- [Replication in Distributed Systems - Part 2 - Manthan](https://manthanguptaa.in/posts/replication_in_distributed_systems_part_2/)
	- "*Consistent prefix reads* guarantees that if a sequence of writes happen in a particular order, anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the same order. One solution to this problem is to make sure that an writes that are causally related to each othr are stored in the same partition."
