<li>OpenAI’s servers went down, and my work got paused. That was not
because I heavily rely on OpenAI for coding :smile:. I was working on

<p>I misunderstood the purpose of <code>Node.js</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime
environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend
developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write
the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the
need to learn a completely different language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(copied from the documentation)</p>
<pre><code>const { createServer } = require(&#39;node:http&#39;);

const hostname = &#39;127.0.0.1&#39;;
const port = 3000;

const server = createServer((req, res) =&gt; {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader(&#39;Content-Type&#39;, &#39;text/plain&#39;);
  res.end(&#39;Hello World&#39;);
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () =&gt; {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});</code></pre>
<p>I have seen that Node.js is used as a development server that serves
static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly to the browser.</p>
<p>When deploying the frontend client, I thought Node.js was not
required because once static files are built, they can be hosted
anywhere such as CDN.</p>
<p>However, as outlined in the documentation, Node.js provides the
capability to create API endpoints, whch can be deployed on a Node.js
server. This functionality is crucial for modern frameworks like
Next.js, enabling them to deliver pure static files while leveraging a
separate server for performance optimization. I’ve also heard that many
frontend developers are using TypeScript for building backend APIs
because of its shallow learning curve (for frontend developers).</p>
