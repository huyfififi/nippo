Oh, there is another Codeforces Round tomorrow, but I already participated two contests this week... I'm tired

- Codeforces Global Round 28
	- My rating exceeded 1200, and I became a Pupil. Yay!!!
	- I drank too much coffee to join the contest, and now I feel really sick.
	- I received a message from an unknown user asking for my solution during the contest. It's kind of funny.
	- I understand the desire to achieve a good rating as soon as possible, but focusing on self-improvement is far more important. Using ChatGPT during contests might improve my rating, but it feels like competing in a marathon while riding a bicycle. The true beauty of competition lies in pushing human limits.
