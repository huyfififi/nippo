- made progress on reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"
	- I read a section about the Protocol Buffer and other encoding/decoding programs. I have seen [protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) installed in some dependencies, so the section content was sort of familiar.

## あっという間に人は死ぬから

Humans often tend to avoid stress rather than addressing it directly. To live a meaningful and happy life, we should be mindful of our values and beliefs and take actions alighned with them.

In the book, tips, scientific research, and the author's thoughts are interwined, and I found it hard to follow her message. It made me so sleepy.

In summary, the book did not give me new perspectives.
