<ul>
<li>made progress on reading “Designing Data-Intensive Applications”
<ul>
<li>I read a section about the Protocol Buffer and other
encoding/decoding programs. I have seen <a
href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf">protobuf</a>
installed in some dependencies, so the section content was sort of
familiar.</li>

<p>Humans often tend to avoid stress rather than addressing it directly.
To live a meaningful and happy life, we should be mindful of our values
and beliefs and take actions alighned with them.</p>
<p>In the book, tips, scientific research, and the author’s thoughts are
interwined, and I found it hard to follow her message. It made me so
sleepy.</p>
<p>In summary, the book did not give me new perspectives.</p>
