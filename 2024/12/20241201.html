<h2 id="memo-designing-data-intensive-applications-chapter-3">MEMO:
Designing Data-Intensive Applications Chapter 3</h2>
<p>This chapter covers the implementation of databases’ read-and-write
operations. Although the content is quite interesting, I don’t find much
content relatable to my everyday work as an application engineer.
Therefore, I will write down some clluttered memos for myself.</p>
<p><strong>The use of the word “log”</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word log is often used to refer to application logs, where an
application outputs text that describes what’s happening. In this book,
<em>log</em> is used in the more general sense: an append-only sequence
of records. It doesn’t have to be human-readable; it might be binary and
intended only for other programs to read.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="oltp-and-olap">OLTP and OLAP</h3>
<p>OLTP: online transaction processing</p>
<p>OLAP: online analytic processing</p>
<p>It is a common practice among big companies to have a read-only and
separated copy of application data (from the main OLTP systems) for data
analysis. The separated database is called <em>data warehouse</em>.</p>
<p>This way, we can ensure that the queries for data analysis run by
non-engineers do not affect the central OLTP database, and by separating
databases for different uses, we can optimize a data warehouse, in which
we run OLAP-type (analytic-type) queries.</p>
<p>The process to populate a data warehouse with application data is
called <em>Extract-Transform-Load</em> (ETL).</p>
<p>A data warehouse is commonly designed as <em>column-oriented
storage</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea behind <em>column-oriented storage</em> is simple: don’t
store all the values from one row together, but store all the values
from each <em>column</em> together instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A normal relational database is <em>row-oriented</em>, in a way that
the entire row will be fetched from the database, and its columsn are
tightly coupled (cannot extract some of them effectively).</p>
<p>I will skip the explanation of the <em>column-oriented</em> or
<em>materialized views</em> (which cache the results of queries that are
frequently used) for now.</p>
<h3 id="indexes">Indexes</h3>
<p>This chapter also covers a wide range of the implementations of
indexes. Starting from hash indexes, they show extensive forms or
improvements of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any kind of index usually slows down writes, because the index also
needs to be updated every time data is written.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an important trade-off in storage systems: well-chosen
indexes speed up read queries, but every index slows down writes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around two years ago, my colleague tried to add a bunch of indexes
that seemed to be rarely used, and I left a comment on his pull request
opposing the addition, but most of the collaborators did not think it
was problematic, and the pull request was merged.</p>
<p>I don’t blame them at all as we did our best, but I wish I had read
this book at that time so that I could have been more helpful to the
team.</p>
<h4 id="hash-indexes">Hash Indexes</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the simplest possible indexing strategy is this: keep an
in-memory hash map where every key is mapped to a byte offset in the
data file (the location at which the value can be found).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach is adopted by Bitcask.</p>
<p>Although this approach works efficiently both for reads and writes,
but there are some limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire hash table must fit in memory because a key-value data
structure is used.</li>
<li>Range queries are not efficient because a simple key-value pair only
has access to a single record, and we need to iterate through each key
to perform range queries.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sorted-string-table-sstable">Sorted String Table (SSTable)</h4>
<p>On top of the hash indexes approach, keys are sorted. This constraint
does not directly address the problems of the hash indexes, but it
provides several improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indexes are implemented to break data down into segments, and
SStable is more efficient in terms of segment mergers because we can do
something like mergesort to merge sorted segments.</li>
<li>We can reduce the number of keys in memory compared to the hash
indexes approach by leveraging the fact that we can instantly pick a
segment by specifying a range.
<ul>
<li>I know I should provide more explanations, but let me skip that for
today.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compression is also efficient, grouping records in a range into a
block.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="log-structured-merge-tree-lsm-tree">Log-Structured Merge-Tree
(LSM-Tree)</h4>
<p>I repeated reading the section, but I could not get the definition of
LSM-Tree. I will research this later (maybe).</p>
<p>LSM-Tree seems to be a principle/strategy of data management, using
SSTable as building blocks, but I’m not confident.</p>
<p>LSM-Tree seems not to be a tree structure in the conventional sense
such as Binary Tree.</p>
<p><strong>Bloom Filter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Bloom filter is a memory-efficient data structure for approximating
the contents of a set. It can tell you if a key does not appear in the
database, and thus saves many unnecessary disk reads for nonexistent
keys.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="b-trees">B-Trees</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The most widely used indexing structure</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>B-trees break the database down into fixeed-size blocks or pages,
traditionally 4KB in size (sometimes bigger), and read or write one page
at a time (whereas the log-structured indexes break the database down
into variable-sized segments). This design corresponds more closely to
the underlying hardware, as disks are also arranged in fixed-size
blocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implementation of B-trees is quite impressive, but without
illustrations, it’s very hard to explain. Ask me to buy this book for
you.</p>
<p>This section ends with the comparision of B-Trees and LSM-Trees</p>
