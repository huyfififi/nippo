<li>There are many jargons I’m not aware of.</li>
<li>Failover caused data inconsistencies by promoting a new leader (in
the context of leader-based replication) with outdated data, assigning
primary keys that were already used to new records, making them visible
from users without the right permissions.</li>

And Motion - Joel on Software</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_and_movement">Fire and
movement</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fire and movement can be performed by any unit made up of at least
two soldiers. The first part of the military unit suppresses the enemy
by firing from behind cover, while the second advances. After a short
time, the advancing unit will halt behind cover and open fire, allowing
the first unit to advance. The two parts of the unit will repeat the
cycle until the objective is met.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fire and Motion is a strategy focused on continuously firing and
moving forward so that opponents can’t effetively return fire, and
eventually, you can take them down.</p>
<p>Joel uses another analogy to highlight the importance of simply
getting started. Much like riding a bike, it takes significant effort to
get moving, but once you’ve built up some speed, it’s much easier to
maintain your momentum with less effort.</p>
<p>From what I understand, his main message is that the key to success
is to get started (!) and keep going, even if the pace feels slow.</p>
<p>Fire and movement is becoming my motto.</p>
