<blockquote>
<p>At first, people wrote code, and spend a lot of time debugging. Than
someone came up with the idea of asserting that some set of things
should never happen. Now there are two kinds of assertions, the ones
where you assert that an object will never get into on inconsistent
state and the ones where you assert that objects never gets passed a
incorrect value…</p>

<p>The author continues with some bad-practices of assertions on
<code>null</code>, but it's not directly relevant to my scenario.</p>

Overflow - The four purposes of <code>assert</code></a></h3>
<p>Assume you work on 200,000 lines of code with four colleagues Alice,
Bernd, Carl, and Daphne. They call your code, you call their code.</p>
<p>Then assert has four roles:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Inform Alice, Bernd, Carl, and Daphne what your code expects.
(…omitted)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Inform the computer what your code expects. (…omitted)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Inform the readers of your code (including yourself) what your code
has achieved at some point. (…omitted)</li>
</ol>

<p>The detailed explanations are very informative, and my thought is
very similar to this post.</p>
<p>The simplest idea is that <code>assert</code> can be considered a
comment that gets checked. We can be aware when something that should
never happen occurs.</p>
