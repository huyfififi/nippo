# 20241022

- Upgraded my Mastodon server to [v4.3.1](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.3.1)
	- With `git checkout --theirs (path)`, it\'s much easier to resolve merge conflicts now. I\'m getting confidence running the server.
- Created a release in [huyfififi/mytree](https://github.com/huyfififi/mytree)
	- There is room for improvement tho.
	- At least, it should work in most cases.
