# 20241025 â—Ž

I thought my performance in the last Codeforces round was bad, but my rating did not hurt much (it\'s still very low though). I guess the problems were a bit difficult.

Writing tests is super helpful. I've been working on test coverage this week and have noticed many bugs (including mine :sweat:) already.

Because could not get enough sleep in the last few days, I feel tired and sleepy. It might be better to go to bed now...

## Counting insertions/deletions in a Git repository

### [`git diff --stat`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#Documentation/git-diff.txt---statltwidthgtltname-widthgtltcountgt)

Motivation: I got curious about how many files I changed, how many insertions I made, and how many lines I deleted.

```
rag$ git diff HEAD~5 --stat
 README.md                           |  6 +++---
 app/api/main.py                     |  2 ++
 app/api/routes/health.py            | 14 ++++++++++++++
 app/models.py                       | 11 +++++++++++
 app/tests/api/routes/test_health.py | 14 ++++++++++++++
 poetry.lock                         | 14 +++++++-------
 pyproject.toml                      |  4 ++--
 7 files changed, 53 insertions(+), 12 deletions(-)
```

```
rag$ git diff HEAD~5 --stat --stat-count=0 --stat-width=40 --stat-name-width=5
 ...md |  6 +++---
 ...py |  2 ++
 ...py | 14 ++++++++++++++
 ...py | 11 +++++++++++
 ...py | 14 ++++++++++++++
 ...ck | 14 +++++++-------
 ...ml |  4 ++--
 7 files changed, 53 insertions(+), 12 deletions(-)
```

The three options `width`, `name-width`, and `count` seem to be the only options available for `--stat`.

### [`git diff --shortstat`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#Documentation/git-diff.txt---shortstat)

I was browsing the documentation and noticed that there is a compact version of `--stat`.

```
rag$ git diff HEAD~5 --shortstat
 7 files changed, 53 insertions(+), 12 deletions(-)
```

They look useful, but as I skimmed the documentation page and googled some, my goal cannot be achieved with `git diff`. Actually, there seem not to be the specific one to get the metrics of the entire commit history. I might want to do some programming with `awk`.

### `git log --author="Author Name" --shortstat | awk`

I got that! Tada!

```
rag$ git log --author="huyfififi" --shortstat | awk '/files changed/ {files += $1} /insertion/ {insertions += $4} /deletion/ {deletions += $6} END {print files changed, "files changed," insertions, "insertions(+),", deletions, "deletions(-)"}'
18 files changed,597 insertions(+), 492 deletions(-)
```

This will be one of my favorite command (program? since awk is a programming language).

I tried with a project with a huge commit history, but the command returned my metrics instantly. How efficient the Git algorithm is! I still can\'t believe Linus Torvalds managed to invent Linux and Git.
