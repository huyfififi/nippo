- Refactored [huyfififi/mytree](https://github.com/huyfififi/mytree)
	- Replaced INI-based configuration with JSON-based one
	- Refactored many parts, as it\'s been a long time since I created the repository.
- Revisited [Disjoint Set Union by Abhinav Sharma | HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/abhinav92003/disjoint-set-union/)
	- "*Notice that we used the function call findParent( i ) to find the parent of the ith node, instead of directly looking at parent[ i ]. The reason for this is: The parent of a node is not changed as soon as its affiliation to a connected component is changed. We postpone this to when we actually need to find the parent of the node. Doing this avoids many useless operations. So, parent[ i ] may not contain the updated value of the connected component that i belongs to. That's why it's important that we use findParent( i ) instead of being lazy and taking the value directly from parent[ i ]*"
	- I skipped the calculation of its time complexity for now..

I\'m reading Alain\'s propos, but they are very boring... hard to understand what he is trying to say.
