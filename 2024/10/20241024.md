My nerves were not relaxed, and I could not get sleep at all.

My circadian rhythm is getting broken again.

- Participated in Codeforces Round 981 (Div. 3)
	- My performance was terrible. I was about to lose my motivation, but I rethought that I should be proud of being out of my comfort zone.
		- Actually, I have been out of my comfort zone throughout my entire life (?).
