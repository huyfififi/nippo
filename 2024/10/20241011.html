<p>Worked with my friend at a shared office. Even for introverts such as
myself, it's good to enjoy social time sometimes.</p>
<p>Worked very hard to finish some research tasks, such as OpenAI
billing.</p>
<p>I gave a 1-on-1 session (2 hours!) about Git and basic concepts in
Web applications to my friend’s girlfriend. <a

<p>I understand the use of Git is intimidating at first. It’s been a
long since I understood (to some extent) Git, but I still remember the
struggles I had when I was in college.</p>
<p>I’m totally fine using my time guiding others, and I truly hope that
session changed her life a little bit.</p>
<p>Due to my health issue, I could not write something meaningful in
this daily report these days, but I hope I can tomorrow.</p>
