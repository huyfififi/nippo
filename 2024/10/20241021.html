<p>I think I better resume working on the competitive-programming… If I
have a nice, kind, and smart friend who can share time with me and study
algorithms, it would be super helpful for me. Though, I think it's one
in a million to have someone like Steve Wozniak. Steve Jobs is so lucky
to have him in his life.</p>
<h2 id="mastodon-version-upgrade">Mastodon Version Upgrade</h2>
<p>I tried to update my Mastodon instance with the latest version, but
there are 66 (!) files that have conflicts. I don't want to deal with
them. Why are there so many conflicts though I didn't touch them
:angry:</p>
<pre><code>$ git merge v4.3.0
$ git status --short | grep -E -c &#39;^(UU|AA)&#39;
66</code></pre>
<p>It's been a year since I (as a moron) deployed the Mastodon server,
and it seems many tech debts accumulated along the way.</p>
<p>It would be much easier to create a new instance and move my account
to it. Still, on second thought, account migration is also a headache,
and I want to maintain the domain if possible, as I built some
friendships on it.</p>
<p>And now, my Mastodon server is running with v4.3.0! Yay!</p>

id="git-checkout---theirs-."><code>git checkout --theirs .</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://nitaym.github.io/ourstheirs/">git - ours &amp;
theirs</a></p>
<p>Today I learned that I can use <code>git checkout --theirs .</code>
to accept all incoming changes when resolving merge conflicts. Git is a
very genius tool, but sometimes it shows me too many diffs even though I
didn't touch the code. This option is convenient in that case.</p>
<pre><code>$ git merge v4.3.0
(shows a bunch of conflicts)
$ git checkout --theirs .
$ git add .
$ git commit</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://nitaym.github.io/ourstheirs/">Git - git-checkout
Documentation</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When checking out paths from the index, check out stage #2 (ours) or
#3 (theirs) for unmerged paths.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that during <code>git rebase</code> and
<code>git pull --rebase</code>, ours and theirs may appear swapped;
<code>--ours</code> gives the version from the branch the changes are
rebased onto, while <code>--theirs</code> gives the version from the
branch that holds your work that is being rebased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I should remember this, as I frequently use
<code>git rebase</code>.</p>
<h2 id="unix-time">Unix time</h2>
<p>I failed to explain the Unix epoch to my friend the other day.</p>

Wikipedia</a> (I know it's not right to cite Wikipedia, but I would make
an excuse that this page is not something academic or official.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Unix time</strong> is a date and time representation widely
used in computing. It measures time by the number of non-leap seconds
that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, the Unix epoch.
In modern computing, values are sometimes stored with higher
granularity, such as microseconds or nanoseconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Unix time originated as the system time of Unix operation systems. It
has come to be widely used in other computer operating systems, file
systems, programming languages, and databases.</p>
</blockquote>

Times - Win32 apps | Microsoft Learn</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A file time is a 64-bit value that represents the number of
100-nanosecond intervals that have elapsed since 12:00 A.M. January 1,
1601 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The system records file times
when applications create, access, and write to files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems the Windows NTFS file system uses a different time
representation than Unix time, and there are also some that don't use
it.</p>
