I\'m getting recovered!!

- Read "勇気が出る ゆうき式マジックワード"
- Finished reading "Think Faster, Talk Smarter: How to Speak Successfully When You're Put on the Spot"
	- There were only a few things new to me. Most of the techniques mentioned in this book are ones I have already used.
	- But it might be a good idea to have this as a reference and come back when necessary.
	- One of the suggestions I found interesting is to talk about the atmosphere/scene instead of asking about occupations or hobbies when mingling. I will try this, but I\'m not sure when, though.

## Spam Attacks on Fediverse

Unlike traditional SNS (Social Networking Service), Fediverse consists of multiple independent servers that speak the same protocol. With the same idea as Bitcoin, the idea has been getting traction to go against central models such as Twitter or Facebook.

Although the Fediverse model has some advantages over the traditional model, e.g., users\' posting rights won't be deprived because they can just host their servers to communicate with others, and big companies cannot interfere with their decisions (mostly), the Fediverse also has some drawbacks. One of them is the difficulty of blocking malicious attacks such as spamming.

With the central authority model, one moderator can just ban a malicious user from the system, and it\'s done. A well-known example might be X (ex Twitter), in which users will get banned from their moderators, and they need to go through a lengthy recovery process to get their accounts back.
On the other hand, there are no central authorities in Fediverse, and it\'s totally possible to sign up for 1000 servers with one email address. Many servers are not actively moderated, and malicious users can just use the servers to perform actions such as spam attacks. Also, due to its nation\'s need to connect with other servers openly, it's hard to limit requests from different servers in general.

Today, I woke up and found out that my small Mastodon server was down. As I dug in and checked the news from others, someone seemed to run a script that signs up for an account in un-moderated Fediverse servers and sends a bunch of spam messages to other accounts. 

### Checking blocked users

```
$ docker exec -it db psql

postgres=# \c mastodon
You are now connected to database "mastodon" as user "postgres".

mastodon=# \dt
                       List of relations
 Schema |                Name                | Type  |  Owner
--------+------------------------------------+-------+----------
 public | accounts                           | table | mastodon
 ...
 public | blocks                             | table | mastodon

mastodon=# SELECT a.username, a.display_name, a.domain, a.url FROM accounts a INNER JOIN blocks b ON a.id = b.target_account_id;
   username   | display_name |       domain        |                   url

```

As I checked the domains, I found that all of them lack safeguards to sign up for, and also, server admins have been inactive for a long time.

I generally enjoy Fediverse, but I see some drawbacks these days, such as today\'s incident.
