slept from 7:00 am to 9:00 pm :scream: I\'m still suffering from the side effects of the medication.

GitHub has been the SNS where I\'m the most active, though it\'s hard to find a project that I can contribute to with my skill set.

The problem with a personal project is that I cannot seek advice or get positive/negative feedback until it gets real traction. I believe the feedback loop is the key to keeping motivation.
