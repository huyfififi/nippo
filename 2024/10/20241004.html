<p>I worked super hard, creating three feature requests and one pull
request for maintenance.</p>
<ul>
<li>I also reviewed code and communicated about the pending tasks… I'm a
workaholic!</li>
</ul>
<p>Somehow, a weird issue we encountered with the Python
<code>openai</code> package is resolved. I have no idea what happened,
but my guesstimate is that the problem was with GitHub Actions
workflows; it sometimes fails with a strange error. I'm too tired to
check the problem in details…</p>
<p>I felt tired and went to bed, but after taking a nap for around 20
minutes, I woke up.</p>
<ul>
<li>As I browsed some web pages, steroids I take to medicate my skin
problems may put me in sort of a manic mode. I can't stop working hard.
I can't fall asleep.</li>
</ul>
