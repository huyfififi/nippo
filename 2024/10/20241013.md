- Read "やりたいことを次々と実現する人の心理術"
- Created wallpapers and set them to remind of daily objectives.

I review pull requests as soon as possible to unblock others\' work, but I noticed that many people don\'t do it.

When I worked with peple who reviewed code freqnently, the experience was very positive, and I was motivated to do more.

However, I heard my friend say that engineers at PayPal don\'t review code unless they are asked to do so.

I\'m involved in some projects outside work, but they are inactive, and to be honest, it pisses me off. Maybe I should just leave the groups for everyone.

## ゆうきゆう - "やりたいことを次々と実現する人の心理術"

- "幸せというのは、連続するものでも、長時間続くものでもないのです。本当の幸せは、もっと小さくて、瞬間のものであると思うのです。"
- "永遠に続く、完全な幸せ。そういうものを目指すことは無意味です。"
- "「幸せは、一瞬だけ感じることがあればいいもの」と思っておけば、普段、喜びを感じていなくても「それが普通」と考えることができます。"

- "幸福・不幸も伝染するのです。だからこそ、不幸は病気と同じで、「治さなければいけない」というわけです。"

## Checking NGINX in my Mastodon instance

I was wondering if I\'m doing something stupid, especially running two different NGINX programs; one is in Docker Compose, and the other is in the host computer.

It turned out that I\'m running NGINX only in Docker Compose.

```
ubuntu@ip-172-26-9-206:~$ sudo systemctl status nginx
○ nginx.service
     Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit nginx.service is masked.)
     Active: inactive (dead)
```

Now, I need to check the complicated NGINX configuration running in Docker Compose...
