# 20241019 ◎

- Went to a Japanese grocery store, bought some ingredients, and meal-prepped some salads for a few days.

I suddenly felt happiness with no specific reason when I drove home. (maybe a side effect of the high-dose steroids)

I did not feel like doing anything, but I managed to go jogging, work out, and do some research. Congrats!

## issubclass(bool, int) is True

I was writing tests and noticed an interesting behavior (at least to me) regarding Python\'s `bool` and `int` classes.

```python
In [1]: isinstance(True, int)
Out[1]: True

In [2]: isinstance(False, int)
Out[2]: True

In [3]: issubclass(bool, int)
Out[3]: True
```

[3. Data model: numbers.Integral - Python 3.13.0 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#numbers-integral)

> There are two types of integers:

> Integers (int)

> > These represent numbers in an unlimited range, subject to available (virtual) memory only. For the purpose of shift and mask operations, a binary representation is assumed, and negative numbers are represented in a variant of 2’s complement which gives the illusion of an infinite string of sign bits extending to the left.

> Booleans (bool)

> > These represent the truth values False and True. The two objects representing the values False and True are the only Boolean objects. The Boolean type is a subtype of the integer type, and Boolean values behave like the values 0 and 1, respectively, in almost all contexts, the exception being that when converted to a string, the strings "False" or "True" are returned, respectively.

So basically, `False` is `0` and `True` is `1` internally, and they are just converted to the strings `"False"` and `"True"` when they are represented to users.

I will keep this in my brain just in case.

## Retry: Disjoint Set Union

I did not understand the details, but it should be helpful to remember the code to get familiar with the logic gradually.

```
def find_parent(i: int, parent: list[int]) -> int:
    if parent[parent[i]] == parent[i]:
        return parent[i]
    return find_parent(parent[i], parent)


def union_sets(i: int, j: int, parent: list[int], size: list[int]) -> None:
    parent_i: int = find_parent(i, parent)
    parent_j: int = find_parent(j, parent)

    if parent_i == parent_j:
        return

    if size[i] < size[j]:
        size[parent_j] += size[parent_i]
        parent[parent_i] = parent_j
    else:
        size[parent_i] += size[parent_j]
        parent[parent_j] = parent_i

    return


def count_disjoint_set(n_node: int, edges: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    parent: list[int] = list(range(n_node))
    size: list[int] = [1] * n_node

    for i, j in edges:
        union_sets(i, j, parent, size)

    for i in range(n_node):
        find_parent(i, parent)

    count: int = 0
    for i in range(n_node):
        if parent[i] == i:  # count the leader
            count += 1

    print("result" + "-" * 40)
    print(f"{edges=}")
    print(f"{parent=}")
    print(f"{size=}")
    print(f"{count=}")

    return count


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # (0, 2, 3, 4), (1, 5), (6, 9), (7), (8)
    n_node: int = 10
    edges: list[tuple[int, int]] = [
        (0, 2),
        (2, 3),
        (4, 3),
        (4, 0),
        (5, 1),
        (6, 9),
    ]
    count_disjoint_set(n_node, edges)

    # (0, 1, 2, 5), (3, 4), (6, 7, 8), (9)
    n_node: int = 10
    edges: list[tuple[int, int]] = [
        (0, 1),
        (0, 2),
        (1, 2),
        (3, 4),
        (5, 2),
        (6, 7),
        (7, 8),
    ]
    count_disjoint_set(n_node, edges)
```
