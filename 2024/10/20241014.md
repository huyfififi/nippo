I suddenly remember the days when my mother said family members should help each other, then demanding too much from me while not offering help to myself.

Now, I\'m almost done with all my relatives and don\'t communicate with them, but I feel that I lost my excuses. When I was in a poor (not limited in wealth) family, I could blame my upbringing for my mistakes or misfortune, but now I\'m expected to take responsibility for all the outcomes.

I cannot deny that I\'m less sad now, but I am still trying to figure out my life.

At least, I\'m proud of what I have achieved so far. Even if anyone else did my life, they couldn\'t have done better than me.
