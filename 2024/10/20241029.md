- Went to see a dentist
- communicated with the doctor
	- He said that I would not need another prescription for steriods
- Read [We\'re forking Flutter. This is why.](https://flutterfoundation.dev/blog/posts/we-are-forking-flutter-this-is-why/)
	- TIL: Flutter was created by Google
	- I wish I could contribute to OSS so bad
- Checked how to set branch rules in GitHub

## Retry: Topological Sort

I completely forgot about the algorithm, so this is just my attempt to make it work.

[Topological sorting - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting)

> ### Kahn's algorithm

> One of these algorithms, first described by Kahn (1962), works by choosing vertices in the same order as the eventual topological sort. First, find a list of "start nodes" that have no incoming edges and insert them into a set S; at least one such node must exist in a non-empty (finite) acyclic graph. Then:

```
L ← Empty list that will contain the sorted elements
S ← Set of all nodes with no incoming edge

while S is not empty do
    remove a node n from S
    add n to L
    for each node m with an edge e from n to m do
        remove edge e from the graph
        if m has no other incoming edges then
            insert m into S

if graph has edges then
    return error   (graph has at least one cycle)
else
    return L   (a topologically sorted order)
```

```python
from collections import deque

n = 6
edges: list[tuple[int, int]] = [
    (5, 0),
    (5, 2),
    (3, 1),
    (4, 0),
    (4, 1),
    (2, 3),
]

result: list[int] = []

incoming: list[int] = [0] * n
for s, t in edges:
    incoming[t] += 1

q = deque()
for node_i in range(n):
    if incoming[node_i] == 0:
        q.append(node_i)

while q:
    node_to_remove = q.popleft()
    for s, t in edges:
        if s == node_to_remove:
            incoming[t] -= 1
            if incoming[t] == 0:
                q.append(t)
    result.append(node_to_remove)

print(result)
# [4, 5, 0, 2, 3, 1]
```

I didn\'t optimize the code, but now I remember the algorithm (to some extent).

We count the number of incoming edges, remove node with no incoming edges from the graph, update the incoming edge counts, and repeat these steps.

20231030: by converting the edge list into a hashmap will decrease the time complexity to (V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
