## [Topological Sorting - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/)

The implementation is a bit different as it does not strictly follow the Kahn\'s algorithm maintaining a set of vertices with no incoming edges.

The implementation does not fit in my brain right now, but it is worth remembering the existence of this variation.

```python
def topological_sort_util(
    v: int,
    adj: list[list[int]],
    visited: list[bool],
    stack: list,
):
    visited[v] = True

    for i in adj[v]:
        if not visited[i]:
            topological_sort_util(i, adj, visited, stack)

    stack.append(v)


def topological_sort(adj: list[list[int]], V: int):
    # stack to store the result
    stack = []

    visited = [False] * V

    for i in range(V):
        if not visited[i]:
            topological_sort_util(i, adj, visited, stack)

    result = []
    while stack:
        result.append(stack.pop())
    return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    V = 4
    edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 1], [3, 2]]
    adj = [[] for _ in range(V)]

    for s, t in edges:
        adj[s].append(t)

    result = topological_sort(adj, V)
    print(result)  # [3, 0, 1, 2]
```

### Retry Kahn\'s algorithm

```python
from collections import defaultdict


def topological_sort(V, edges_map, incoming) -> list[int]:
    result = []

    stack = []
    for v in range(V):
        if incoming[v] == 0:
            stack.append(v)

    while stack:
        v_to_remove = stack.pop()
        for target_v in edges_map[v_to_remove]:
            incoming[target_v] -= 1
            if incoming[target_v] == 0:
                stack.append(target_v)
        result.append(v_to_remove)

    return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    V = 4
    edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)]

    incoming = [0] * V
    for s, t in edges:
        incoming[t] += 1

    edges_map = defaultdict(list)
    for s, t in edges:
        edges_map[s].append(t)

    result = topological_sort(V, edges_map, incoming)
    print(result)  # [3, 0, 1, 2]
```

A doubt on its time complexity arises, but I lack the ability to consider the problem right now. I\'ll come back later.
