I worked super hard, creating three feature requests and one pull request for maintenance.

- I also reviewed code and communicated about the pending tasks... I\'m a workaholic!

Somehow, a weird issue we encountered with the Python `openai` package is resolved. I have no idea what happened, but my guesstimate is that the problem was with GitHub Actions workflows; it sometimes fails with a strange error. I\'m too tired to check the problem in details...

I felt tired and went to bed, but after taking a nap for around 20 minutes, I woke up.

- As I browsed some web pages, steroids I take to medicate my skin problems may put me in sort of a manic mode. I can\'t stop working hard. I can\'t fall asleep.
