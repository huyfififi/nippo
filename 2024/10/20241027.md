> With her magic, she can select a square area of mountains and increase the height of each mountain on the main diagonal of that area by exactly one.

To mazimize the effect her magic, she can pick one diagonal whose `i - j = l (-n <= l <= n)` in one action. When two diagonals have differnt `i - j`, then they cannot be modified in the same operation.

Therefore, we can iterate over the diagonals and sum up the minimum value for each diagonal.

```python
from collections import defaultdict


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n: int = int(input())
    a: list[list[int]] = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

    min_in_diagonal = defaultdict(int)

    for row_i in range(n):
        for col_i in range(n):
            diff: int = row_i - col_i
            min_in_diagonal[diff] = min(min_in_diagonal[diff], a[row_i][col_i])

    print(-sum(min_in_diagonal.values()))
```
