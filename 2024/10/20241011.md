Worked with my friend at a shared office. Even for introverts such as myself, it\'s good to enjoy social time sometimes.

Worked very hard to finish some research tasks, such as OpenAI billing.

I gave a 1-on-1 session (2 hours!) about Git and basic concepts in Web applications to my friend's girlfriend. [gomyway1216/rag](https://github.com/gomyway1216/rag)

I understand the use of Git is intimidating at first. It's been a long since I understood (to some extent) Git, but I still remember the struggles I had when I was in college.

I'm totally fine using my time guiding others, and I truly hope that session changed her life a little bit.

Due to my health issue, I could not write something meaningful in this daily report these days, but I hope I can tomorrow.
