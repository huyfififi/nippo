<li>“<em>Notice that we used the function call findParent( i ) to find
the parent of the ith node, instead of directly looking at parent[ i ].
The reason for this is: The parent of a node is not changed as soon as
its affiliation to a connected component is changed. We postpone this to
when we actually need to find the parent of the node. Doing this avoids
many useless operations. So, parent[ i ] may not contain the updated
value of the connected component that i belongs to. That’s why it’s
important that we use findParent( i ) instead of being lazy and taking
the value directly from parent[ i ]</em>”</li>
