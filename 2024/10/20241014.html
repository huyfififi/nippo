<p>I suddenly remember the days when my mother said family members
should help each other, then demanding too much from me while not
offering help to myself.</p>
<p>Now, I'm almost done with all my relatives and don't communicate with
them, but I feel that I lost my excuses. When I was in a poor (not
limited in wealth) family, I could blame my upbringing for my mistakes
or misfortune, but now I'm expected to take responsibility for all the
outcomes.</p>
<p>I cannot deny that I'm less sad now, but I am still trying to figure
out my life.</p>
<p>At least, I'm proud of what I have achieved so far. Even if anyone
else did my life, they couldn't have done better than me.</p>
