<h2 id="getting-a-certificate-from-lets-encrypt">Getting a certificate
from Let's Encrypt</h2>
<h3 id="challenge-types---lets-encrypt"><a
href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/">Challenge Types -
Let's Encrypt</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When you get a certificate from Let’s Encrypt, our servers validate
that you control the domain names in that certificate using
“challenges,” as defined by the ACME standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="http-01-challenge">HTTP-01 challenge</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the most common challenge type today.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s Encrypt gives a token to your ACME client, and your ACME client
puts a file on your web server at
<code>http://&lt;YOUR_DOMAIN&gt;/.well-known/acme-challenge/&lt;TOKEN&gt;</code>.
That file contains the token, plus a thumbprint of your account key.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once your ACME client tells Let’s Encrypt that the file is ready,
Let’s Encrypt tries retrieving it (potentially multiple times from
multiple vantage points).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If our validation checks get the right responses from your web
server, the validation is considered successful and you can go on to
issue your certificate. If the validation checks fail, you’ll have to
try again with a new certificate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The HTTP-01 challenge can only be done on port 80. Allowing clients
to specify arbitrary ports would make the challenge less secure, and so
it is not allowed by the ACME standard.</p>

<h3 id="what-happend-when-i-ran-certbot-renew">What happend when I ran
<code>certbot renew</code>?</h3>
<pre><code>$ pwd
/etc/letsencrypt/renewal
$ cat domain.conf
# renew_before_expiry = 30 days
version = 1.21.0
archive_dir = /etc/letsencrypt/archive/{domain}
cert = /etc/letsencrypt/live/{domain}/cert.pem
privkey = /etc/letsencrypt/live/{domain}/privkey.pem
chain = /etc/letsencrypt/live/{domain}/chain.pem
fullchain = /etc/letsencrypt/live/{domain}/fullchain.pem

# Options used in the renewal process
[renewalparams]
account = 
pref_challs = http-01,
authenticator = standalone
server = https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory</code></pre>
<p>As I can see <code>authenticator = standalone</code>, I did not use
NGINX or other server softwares.</p>
<p><a
href="https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#standalone">User
Guide - Certbot 2.11.0 documentation | Standalone</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use standalone mode to obtain a certificate if you don’t want to use
(or don’t currently have) existing server software. The standalone
plugin does not rely on any other server software running on the machine
where you obtain the certificate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To obtain a certificate using a “standalone” webserver, you can use
the standalone plugin by including <code>certonly</code> and
<code>--standalone</code> on the command line. This plugin needs to bind
to port 80 in order to perform domain validation, so you may need to
stop your existing webserver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I could get a certificate from Let's Encrypt without
running NGINX :upside_down_face:</p>
<h3 id="struggles-with-nginx-configuration">Struggles with NGINX
configuration</h3>
<pre><code>server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name example.com;
  root /home/mastodon/live/public;
  location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ { allow all; }
  location / { return 301 https://$host$request_uri; }
}</code></pre>
<p>I have this <code>nginx.conf</code>. A file should be created at
/home/mastodon/live/.well-known/acme-challenge, and the challenge to
download this file should succeed, but it does not.</p>
<p>I consulted with ChatGPT, but could not find out what Imissing. I
don't have any friends who are familiar with these sort of network
configurations… shoot!</p>
<hr />
<p>I suddenly remember the days when my mother said family members
should help each other, then demanding too much from me while not
offering help to myself.</p>
<p>Now, I'm almost done with all my relatives and don't communicate with
them, but I feel that I lost my excuses. When I was in a poor (not
limited in wealth) family, I could blame my upbringing for my mistakes
or misfortune, but now I'm expected to take responsibility for all the
outcomes.</p>
<p>I cannot deny that I'm less sad now, but I am still trying to figure
out my life.</p>
<p>At least, I'm proud of what I have achieved so far. Even if anyone
else did my life, they couldn't have done better than me.</p>
