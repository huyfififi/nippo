# 20260104

- replied to Nishimura-san
- LeetCode 206. Reverse Linked List
	- code review (variable names do not reflect their values/meanings)
	- it was unexpectedly hard to write the solution...
- replied to Noda-san's comment
- LeetCode 207\. Course Schedule (Kahn's algorithm, DFS)
- LeetCode 208\. Implement Trie
	- C++ memory leak (free memory or use `std::unique_ptr` / `std::shared_ptr`)
	- PR: [https://github.com/huyfififi/coding-challenges/pull/35](https://github.com/huyfififi/coding-challenges/pull/35)
- sorted out Dependabot PRs (full-time position)

# 20260103

- LeetCode 20\. Valid Parentheses
	- checked review comments
		- std::stack.empty() over std::stack.size() == 0
		- for historical reasons, when writing if condition, "...curly braces may be omitted if as a result the entire statement appears on either a single line")
- LeetCode 207\. Course Schedule
	- checked review comments
		- received feedback from Noda-san here: [https://github.com/huyfififi/coding-challenges/pull/34](https://github.com/huyfififi/coding-challenges/pull/34)
		- I was forgetting that dict keys can be traversed without `dict.keys()`
		- C++: array cannot be created with a size that depends on run time execution
		- retried Kahn's algorithm
		- tackled the vector-based approach (replace `std::set` -> `std::vector` by defining num class constants)
	- LeetCode went down :sweat:
- 30 minutes walk, push ups
- leetCode 21\. Merge Two Sorted Lists
	- "Use values to own data, pointers to traverse linked structures, and references to alias a specific object." by ChatGPT
	- `list1` -> address of node, `*list1` -> the node itself
	- Every new must have a corresponding delete.
- LeetCode 122\. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
	- 1 -> 5 is equivalent to 1 -> 3 and 3 -> 5 (greedy)
	- complicated DP

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(std::vector<int>& prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            profit += std::max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```

- LeetCode 207\. Course Schedule
	- A closure = a function + the variables it captures from outside
	- in most cases, simple DFS or BFS is enough
		- English grammar: A or B → verb agrees with the nearest subject
	- DFS
	- Kahn's algorithm (BFS)
	- PR: [https://github.com/huyfififi/coding-challenges/pull/34](https://github.com/huyfififi/coding-challenges/pull/34)
- LeetCode 20\. Valid Parentheses
	- code review (dangling else, No newline at end of file, return bool, map variable name)

# 20260101

- LeetCode 1. Two Sum
	- double for loops
	- std::map
	- std::sort, auto [variable1, variable 2]
	- std::vector can be passed by value in addition to by reference, but the most common pattern is const + reference as it can block modifications + eliminate the need of copying values
