<p>fmt.Scanln(&amp;var) to scan from stdin</p>
<p>I browsed some of the submissions of others, but they seem to use
“bufio” instead of “fmt” to read input. I have little knowledge of the
difference at the moment. Maybe I can check that tmr, I don’t think it’s
very important for a newbie like me tho.</p>
<h2 id="programming-languages">Programming languages</h2>
<p>It’s been a while since I began learning Rust and Go. Of course, I’m
not at the level that I can get a full-time position with them, but I
find it interesting that programming languages try to address issues in
very different ways.</p>
